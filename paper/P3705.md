# Motivation

Consider using `std::views::take` to get the first five characters from a string. If we
pass a string literal with five or more characters, it looks okay:

```cpp
static_assert(std::string{std::from_range, "Brubeck" | std::views::take(5)} == "Brube"); // passes
```

However, if we pass it a string literal with fewer than five characters, we get in trouble:

```cpp
// static_assert(std::string{std::from_range, "Dave" | std::views::take(5)} == "Dave"); // fails
using namespace std::string_view_literals;
static_assert(std::string{std::from_range, "Dave" | std::views::take(5)} == "Dave\0"sv); // passes
```

The reason the null terminator is included in the output here is because undecayed string
literals are arrays of characters, including the null terminator, which the ranges library
treats like any other array:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <array>
#include <type_traits>

static_assert(std::is_same_v<std::remove_reference_t<decltype("foo")>, const char[4]>);
static_assert(std::ranges::equal("foo", std::array{'f', 'o', 'o', '\0'}));
```

A common workaround is to wrap the string literal in `std::string_view`. But this has a
performance cost: despite the fact that we only care about the first five characters, we
still need to make a pass through the entire string to find the null terminator:

```cpp
constexpr std::string take_five(char const* long_string) {
  std::string_view const long_string_view = long_string; // read all of long_string!
  return std::string{std::from_range, long_string_view | std::views::take(5)};
}
```

This paper introduces `null_sentinel` to solve this problem. It ends the range when it
encounters a null:

```cpp
constexpr std::string take_five(char const* long_string) {
  std::ranges::subrange const long_string_range(long_string, std::null_sentinel); // lazy!
  return std::string{std::from_range, long_string_range | std::views::take(5)};
}
```

It also introduces a `null_term` CPO for the common case of constructing a subrange like
the one in the above example:

```cpp
constexpr std::string take_five(char const* long_string) {
  return std::string{std::from_range, std::views::null_term(long_string) | std::views::take(5)};
}
```

The sentinel type matches any iterator position `it` at which `*it` is equal to a
value-initialized object of type `iter_value_t<I>`. This works for null-terminated
strings, but can also serve as the sentinel for any range terminated by a
value-initialized value.

For example, `null_term` can be used to iterate `argv` and `environ`. The following program demonstrates this:

```cpp
#include <print>

extern char** environ;

int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  std::println("argv: {}", std::views::null_term(argv));
  std::println("environ: {}", std::views::null_term(environ));
}
```

Output:

```
$ env --ignore-environment FOO=bar BAZ=quux ./test corge
argv: ["./test", "corge"]
environ: ["FOO=bar", "BAZ=quux"]
```

# Naming discussion

## Bad names

### `c_str`

`range-v3`
[provides](https://ericniebler.github.io/range-v3/structranges_1_1views_1_1c__str__fn.html)
similar functionality to `null_term` using the name `c_str`-- unlike `null_term`, `c_str`
only works with `char`, `wchar_t`, and so forth.

The name `c_str` would not make sense here because, for example, `std::views::c_str(argv)`
is nonsensical and misleading as to what the range is doing (terminating the sequence of
strings rather than terminating the strings themselves).

### `zstring_sentinel` and `zstring`

An example from Barry Revzin's [@P2210R2] provides similar functionality under the names
`zstring_sentinel` and `zstring`.

I dislike this name for similar reasons as `c_str`. `argv` is not a "string."

Additionally, it invites confusion with [@P3655R1] `zstring_view`.

## Good names

### Status quo: `null_sentinel` and `null_term`

The advantages of these names are that they are terse, they do not include the word
"string," and the value-initialized `iter_value_t` value is referred to as "null," which
reflects the language we use in the standard ("null terminated byte string," "null
terminated multibyte string," "null terminated character sequence," "null pointer")

### `zero_termination_sentinel`

This is used by think-cell's
[implementation](https://github.com/think-cell/think-cell-library/blob/main/tc%2Frange%2Fmeta.h#L248)
of this utility. I like it slightly less because it's more verbose but also consider it
acceptable.

### Your suggestion here

This is not an exhaustive list.


# Wording

## Exposition-only helper concept `@*default-initializable-and-equality-comparable-iter-value*@`

```cpp
namespace std {

  template<class I>
  concept @*default-initializable-and-equality-comparable-iter-value*@ =
    default_initializable<iter_value_t<I>> &&
    equality_comparable_with<iter_reference_t<I>, iter_value_t<I>>; // @*exposition only*@

}
```

## Null sentinel

```cpp
namespace std {

  struct null_sentinel_t {
    template<input_iterator I>
      requires @*default-initializable-and-equality-comparable-iter-value*@<I>
    friend constexpr bool operator==(I const& it, null_sentinel_t);
  };

  inline constexpr null_sentinel_t null_sentinel;

}
```

### Operations

```c++
template<input_iterator I>
  requires @*default-initializable-and-equality-comparable-iter-value*@<I>
friend constexpr bool operator==(I const& it, null_sentinel_t);
```

Effects:

Equivalent to `return *it == iter_value_t<I>();`.

## `null_term` CPO

```cpp
namespace std::views {

  inline constexpr @*unspecified*@ null_term;

}
```

The name `null_term` denotes a customization point object ([customization.point.object]).
Given a subexpression `E`, the expression `null_term(E)` is expression-equivalent to
`ranges::subrange(E, null_sentinel)`.

## Feature test macro

Header `<version>` synopsis [version.syn]

# History

## Changelog

This proposal was originally written by Zach Laine as part of [@P2728R0], then updated and
split out by Eddie Nolan.

### Changes since P2728R1

- Generalize `null_sentinel_t` to a non-Unicode-specific facility.

### Changes since P2728R3

- Change `null_sentinel_t` back to being Unicode-specific.

### Changes since P2728R4

- Move `null_sentinel_t` to `std`, remove its `base` member function, and make
  it useful for more than just pointers, based on SG-9 guidance.

### Changes since P2728R5

- Simplify the complicated constraint on the comparison operator for
  `null_sentinel_t`.

### Changes since P2728R6

- Fix a bug in `null_sentinel_t` causing it not to satisfy `sentinel_for` by
  changing its `operator==` to return `bool`.
- Fix a bug in `null_sentinel_t` where it did not support non-copyable input
  iterators by having `operator==` take input iterators by reference.

### Changes since P2728R7

- Move `null_sentinel` and `null_term` into P3705

### Changes since P3705R0

- Fix off-by-one in textual description in motivation section
- Add example with argv and environ
- Add `unchecked_take_before` design alternative

### Changes since P3705R1

- Remove `unchecked_take_before` and pass-by-value design alternatives
- Add polls and minutes from Sofia 2025 SG9 review
- Move `null_term` to namespace `std::views`
- Add feature test macro
- Add naming discussion
- Use `iter_value_t<I>()` over `iter_value_t<I>{}` to avoid `initializer_list` interaction

## Relevant Polls/Minutes
