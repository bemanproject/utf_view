# High-Level Overview

This paper introduces views and ranges for transcoding between UTF formats:

`static_assert((u8"🙂" | views::to_utf32 | ranges::to<u32string>()) == U"🙂");`

It handles errors by replacing invalid subsequences with �:

`static_assert((u8"🙂" | views::take(3) | to_utf32 | ranges::to<std::u32string>()) == U"�");`

And by providing `or_error` views that provide `std::expected`:

```cpp
static_assert(
  *(u8"🙂" | views::take(3) | views::to_utf32_or_error).begin() ==
  unexpected{utf_transcoding_error::truncated_utf8_sequence});
```

# UTF Primer

If you're already familiar with Unicode, you can skip this section.

The Unicode standard maps _abstract characters_ to _code points_ in the
_Unicode codespace_ from `0` to `0x10FFFF`. Unicode text forms a _coded
character sequence_, "an ordered sequence of one or more code points."
[@Definitions]

The simplest way of encoding code points is UTF-32, which encodes code points
as a sequence of 32-bit unsigned integers. The building blocks of an encoding
are _code units_, and UTF-32 has the most direct mapping between code points
and code units.

![](../../paper/images/utf32.png){ width=400px }

Any values greater than `0x10FFFF` are rejected by validators for being
outside the range of valid Unicode.

Next is UTF-16, which exists for the historical reason that the Unicode
codespace used to top out at `0xFFFF`. Code points outside this range are
represented using _surrogates_, a reserved area in codespace which allows
combining the low 10 bits of two code units to form a single code point.

![](../../paper/images/utf16.png){ width=400px }

![](../../paper/images/utf16_2.png){ width=300px }

UTF-16 is rendered invalid by improper use of surrogates: a high surrogate not
followed by a low surrogate or a low surrogate not preceded by a high
surrogate. Note that the presence of any surrogate code points in UTF-32 is
also invalid.

Finally, UTF-8, the most ubiquitous and most complex encoding. This uses 8-bit
code units. If the high bit of the code unit is unset, the code unit
represents its ASCII equivalent for backwards compatibility. Otherwise the
code unit is either a start byte, which describes how long the subsequence is
(two to four bytes long), or a continuation byte, which fills out the
subsequence with the remaining data.

![](../../paper/images/utf8.png){ width=750px }

![](../../paper/images/utf8_2.png){ width=400px }

UTF-8 code unit sequences can be invalid for many reasons, such as a start
byte not followed by the correct number of continuation bytes, or a UTF-8
subsequence that encodes a surrogate.

_Transcoding_ in this context refers to the conversion of characters between
these three encodings.

# Existing Standard UTF Interfaces in C and C++

## C

C contains an alphabet soup of transcoding functions in `<stdlib.h>`,
`<wchar.h>`, and `<uchar.h>`. [@NTMBS]

This paper doesn't fully litigate these functions' flaws (see WG14
[@WG14N2902] for a more detailed explanation). Some of the issues users
encounter include reliance on an internal global conversion state, reliance on
the current setting of the global C locale, optimization barriers in
one-code-unit-at-a-time function calls, and inadequate error handling that
does not support replacement of invalid subsequences with � as specified by
Unicode.

[Example](https://godbolt.org/z/hrv78oKqo):

```c
setlocale(LC_ALL, "en_US.utf8");
char c[5] = {0};
const char16_t* w = u"\xd83d\xdd74";
mbstate_t state;
memset(&state, 0, sizeof(state));
c16rtomb(c, w[0], &state);
c16rtomb(c, w[1], &state);
const char* e = "\xf0\x9f\x95\xb4";
assert(strcmp(c, e) == 0);
```

## C++

C++'s existing transcoding functionality, other than the aforementioned
functions it inherits from C, consists of the set of `std::codecvt` facets
provided in `<locale>` and `<codecvt>`.

[Example](https://godbolt.org/z/Yncfqeesa):

```cpp
std::wstring_convert<std::codecvt_utf8<char32_t>, char32_t> conv;
std::string c = conv.to_bytes(U"🙂");
assert(c == "\xf0\x9f\x99\x82");
```

All of the Unicode-specific functionality in this header was deprecated in
C++17, and [@P2871R3] and [@P2873R2] finally remove most of it in C++26. There
are many concerns about these interfaces, particularly with respect to
safety.

These functions throw exceptions on encountering invalid UTF. Unicode
functions that use exceptions for error handling are a well-known footgun
because users consistently invoke them on untrusted user input without
handling the exceptions properly, leading to denial-of-service
vulnerabilities.

An example of this anti-pattern (although not involving these specific
functions) can be found in [@CVE-2007-3917], where a multiplayer RPG server
could be crashed by malicious users sending invalid UTF. Below is the patch:
[@wesnoth]

```cpp
@[`-`]{.rm}@ @[`msg = font::word_wrap_text(msg,font::SIZE_SMALL,map_outside_area().w*3/4);       `]{.rm}@
@[`+`]{.add}@ @[`try {                                                                            `]{.add}@
@[`+`]{.add}@     @[`// We've had a joker who send an invalid utf-8 message to crash clients      `]{.add}@
@[`+`]{.add}@     @[`// so now catch the exception and ignore the message.                        `]{.add}@
@[`+`]{.add}@     @[`msg = font::word_wrap_text(msg,font::SIZE_SMALL,map_outside_area().w*3/4);   `]{.add}@
@[`+`]{.add}@ @[`} catch (utils::invalid_utf8_exception&) {                                       `]{.add}@
@[`+`]{.add}@     @[`LOG_STREAM(err, engine) << "Invalid utf-8 found, chat message is ignored.\n";`]{.add}@
@[`+`]{.add}@     @[`return;                                                                      `]{.add}@
@[`+`]{.add}@ @[`}                                                                                `]{.add}@
```

The new functionality proposed by this paper can serve as a safe, modern
replacement for the deprecated and removed `codecvt` facets.

# Replacing Ill-Formed Subsequences with "�"

When a transcoder encounters an invalid subsequence, the modern best practice
is to replace it in the output with one or more � characters (`U+FFFD`,
`REPLACEMENT CHARACTER`). The methodology for doing so is described in §3.9.6
of the Unicode Standard v17.0, Substitution of Maximal Subparts
[@Substitution].

For UTF-32 and UTF-16, each invalid code unit is replaced by an individual �
character.

For UTF-8, the same rule applies except if "a sequence of two or three bytes
is a truncated version of a sequence which is otherwise well-formed to that
point." In the latter case, the full two-to-three byte subsequence is replaced
by a single � character.

For example, UTF-8 encodes 🙂 as `0xF0` `0x9F` `0x99` `0x82`.

If that sequence of bytes is truncated to just `0xF0` `0x9F` `0x99`, it
becomes a single � replacement character.

On the other hand, if the first byte of the four-byte sequence is changed from
`0xF0` to `0xFF`, then it's replaced by four replacement characters, ����,
because no valid UTF-8 subsequence begins with `0xFF`.

More subtly, the subsequence `0xED` `0xA0` must be replaced with two
replacement characters, ��, because any continuation of that subsequence can
only result in a surrogate code point, so it can't prefix any valid
subsequence.

Each of the proposed `to_utfN_view` views adheres to this specification. The
`to_utfN_as_error` views also use this scheme but produce
`unexpected<utf_transcoding_error>` values instead of replacement characters.

# Design Overview

## Transcoding Views

For the sake of simplicity, this explanation applies to the bidirectional
specializations of the transcoding views; the weaker iterator concepts are
explained in the "Pseudo-wording" section.

Invoking `begin()` or `end()` on a transcoding view constructs an instance of
an exposition-only `@*utf-iterator*@` type.

The `@*utf-iterator*@` stores three iterators: `first`, `curr`, and
`last`. `first` and `last` bound the underlying range; the iterator needs
these so that it doesn't read past-the-end or before-the-beginning,
respectively. `curr` is returned by the iterator's `base()` member function,
and is kept at the start of the whatever character is currently being
transcoded.

The `@*utf-iterator*@` maintains a small buffer (`buf`) containing between one
and four code units, which comprise the current character in the target
encoding.

It also maintains an index (`buf_index`) into this buffer, which it increments
or decrements when `operator++` or `operator--` is invoked, respectively. If
it runs out of code units in the buffer, it reads more elements from the
underlying view. `operator*` provides the current element of the buffer.

Below is an approximate block diagram of the iterator.

![](../../paper/images/iterator.png){ width=600px }

The `@*utf-iterator*@` is converting the string `Qϕ学𡪇` from UTF-8 to
UTF-16. The user has iterated the view to the first UTF-16 code unit of the
fourth character. `curr` points to the start of the fourth character in the
input. `buf` contains both UTF-16 code units of the fourth character;
`buf_index` keeps track of the fact that we're currently pointing to the first
one. If we invoke `operator++` on the `@*utf-iterator*@`, it will increment
`buf_index` to point to the second code unit. On the other hand, if we invoke
`operator--`, it will notice that `buf_index` is already at the beginning and
move backward from the fourth character to the third character by invoking
`@*read_reverse*@()`. The `@*read{_reverse}*()` functions contain most of the
actual transcoding logic, filling `buf` up with the transcoded characters.

Iterating a bidirectional transcoding view backwards produces, in reverse
order, the exact same sequence of characters as iterating it forwards.

### `utf_transcoding_error`

Each transcoding view, like `to_utf8_view`, which produces a range of
`char8_t` and handles errors by substituting � replacement characters, has a
corresponding `_or_error` equivalent, like `to_utf8_view_or_error`, which
produces a range of `expected<char8_t, utf_transcoding_error>` and handles
errors by substituting `unexpected<utf_transcoding_error>`s.

Iterating a bidirectional `or_error` view backwards produces, in reverse
order, the exact same sequence of `expected` values as iterating it forwards.

`utf_transcoding_error` is an enumeration whose enumerators are:

- `truncated_utf8_sequence`
    - An ill-formed subsequence that matches the beginning of some well-formed
      sequence.
    - Example invalid code unit sequence: UTF-8 `0xE1 0x80`.
- `unpaired_high_surrogate`
    - Example invalid code unit sequence: UTF-16 `0xD800`.
- `unpaired_low_surrogate`
    - Example invalid code unit sequence: UTF-16 `0xDC00`.
- `unexpected_utf8_continuation_byte`
    - Example invalid code unit sequence: UTF-8 `0x80`.
- `overlong`
    - An overlong UTF-8 encoding.
    - Example invalid code unit sequence: UTF-8 `0xE0 0x80`.
- `encoded_surrogate`
    - Applies to both UTF-8 and UTF-32.
    - Example invalid code unit sequence: UTF-8 `0xED 0xA0`, UTF-32
      `0x0000D800`.
- `out_of_range`
    - Applies to both UTF-8 and UTF-32
    - In UTF-8, this applies to `0xF4` if it is followed by a continuation
      byte greater than `0x8F`
    - In UTF-32, this is any code unit greater than `0x10FFFF`
    - Example invalid code unit sequence: UTF-8 `0xF4 0x90`, UTF-32
      `0x110000`.
- `invalid_utf8_leading_byte`
    - In UTF-8, this applies to `0xC0`-`0xC1` and `0xF5`-`0xFF`.
    - Example invalid code unit sequence: UTF-8 `0xC0`.

An alternative approach to minimize the number of enumerators could merge
`truncated_utf8_sequence` with `unpaired_high_surrogate` and merge
`unexpected_utf8_continuation_byte` with `unpaired_low_surrogate`, but based
on feedback, splitting these up seems to be preferred.

The table below compares the error handling behavior of the `to_utf16` and
`to_utf16_or_error` views on various sample UTF-8 inputs from the
"Substitution of Maximal Subparts" section of the Unicode standard:
[@SubstitutionExamples]

## Iterator Size Growth

A property of `@*utf-iterator*@` is that, because it stores the begin and end
iterator of the underlying view as well as the iterator to the current
position, a pair of `@*utf-iterator*@`s is at least three times as large as a
pair of iterators from the underlying view, leading to geometric growth in
iterator size as views are layered:

![](../../paper/images/viewoptimization2-pt1.png){ width=450px }

(The iterator size grows by factor of three for the bidirectional version of
`@*utf-iterator*@` (depicted in the diagram), but a factor of two for the
forward version, since that version doesn't need to store `begin`.)

The most common situation where transcoding views are nested has to do with
generic code that takes in a view of characters (which may already be a
transcoding view) and unconditionally layers on a second transcoding view:

```cpp
void foo(std::ranges::view auto v) {
#if _MSC_VER
  // On Windows, do something that requires UTF-16
  windows_function(v | to_utf16);
#endif

  // ... etc
}

int main(int, char const* argv[]) {
  foo(std::null_term(argv[1]) | as_char8_t | to_utf32);
}
```

In this specific case, where transcoding views are layered on other
transcoding views, there is an optimization we perform that prevents the
iterator size growth problem. A `@*utf-iterator*@` that wraps another `@*utf-iterator*@` 

## Code Unit Views

# Additional Examples

# Dependencies

The code unit views depend on [@P3117R1] "Extending Conditionally Borrowed".

# Implementation Experience

The most recent revision of this paper has a reference implementation called
[beman.utf_view](https://github.com/bemanproject/utf_view) available on
GitHub, which is a fork of Jonathan Wakely's implementation of P2728R6 as an
implementation detail for libstdc++. It is part of the Beman project.

Versions of the interfaces provided by previous revisions of this paper have
also been implemented, and re-implemented, several times over the last 5 years
or so, as part of a proposed (but not yet accepted!) Boost library,
[Boost.Text](https://github.com/tzlaine/text). Boost.Text has hundreds of
stars on GitHub.

Both libraries have comprehensive tests.

The exposition-only concept `@*to-utf-view-iterator-optimizable*@` is true if
its template parameter is a specialization of `@*utf-iterator*@` and it is a
`@*std::ranges::bidirectional_iterator*@`.

`@*to-utf-view-impl*@` is an exposition-only class that provides
implementation details common to the six transcoding views, `to_utf8_view`,
`to_utf8_or_error_view`, `to_utf16_view`, `to_utf16_or_error_view`,
`to_utf32_view`, and `to_utf32_or_error_view`, which are themselves described
further down.

The iterator type of `@*to-utf-view-impl*@` is
`@*utf-iterator*@`. `@*utf-iterator*@` is an iterator that transcodes from
UTF-N to UTF-M, where N and M are each one of 8, 16, or 32. N may equal
M.

`@*utf-iterator*@` uses a mapping between character types and UTF encodings,
which is that that `char` and `char8_t` correspond to UTF-8, `char16_t`
corresponds to UTF-16, `char32_t` corresponds to UTF-32, and `wchar_t`
corresponds to UTF-16 if its size is two or UTF-32 if its size is 4.

`@*utf-iterator*@` does its work by adapting an underlying range of code
units. We use the term "input subsequence" to refer to a potentially
ill-formed code unit subsequence which is to be transcoded into a code point
`c`. Each input subsequence is decoded from the UTF encoding corresponding to
`@*from-type*@`. If the underlying range contains ill-formed UTF, the code
units are divided into input subsequences according to Substitution of Maximal
Subparts, and each ill-formed input subsequence is transcoded into a
`U+FFFD`. `c` is then encoded to `ToType`'s corresponding encoding, into an
internal code unit buffer.

`@*utf-iterator*@` maintains certain invariants; the invariants differ based
on whether `@*utf-iterator*@` is an input iterator.

For input iterators the invariant is: if `*this` is at the end of the range
being adapted, then `curr()` == `last_`; otherwise, the position of `curr()`
is always at the end of the input subsequence corresponding to the current
code point `c`, and `buf_` contains the code units that comprise `c`, in the
UTF encoding corresponding to `ToType`.

For forward and bidirectional iterators, the invariant is: if `*this` is at
the end of the range being adapted, then `curr()` == `last_`; otherwise, the
position of `curr()` is always at the beginning of the input subsequence
corresponding to the current code point `c` within the underlying range,
and `buf_` contains the code units in `ToFormat` that comprise `c`.

The exposition-only member function `read` decodes the input subsequence
starting at position `curr()` into a code point `c`, using the UTF encoding
corresponding to `@*from-type*@`, and setting `c` to U+FFFD if the input
subsequence is ill-formed. If `c` is set to U+FFFD as the result of an
ill-formed input subsequence, it sets the error as described below. It sets
`to_increment_` to the number of code units read while decoding `c`; encodes
`c` into `buf_` in the UTF encoding corresponding to `ToType`; sets
`buf_index_` to `0`; and sets `buf_last_` to the number of code units encoded
into `buf_`. If `forward_iterator<I>` is `true`, `curr()` is set to the
position it had before `read` was called.

The exposition-only member function `read_reverse` decodes the input
subsequence ending at position `curr()` into a code point `c`, using the UTF
encoding corresponding to `@*from-type*@`, and setting `c` to U+FFFD if the
input subsequence is ill-formed. If `c` is set to U+FFFD as the result of an
ill-formed input subsequence, it sets the error as described below.  It sets
`to_increment_` to the number of code units read while decoding `c`; encodes
`c` into `buf_` in the UTF encoding corresponding to `ToType`; sets
`buf_last_` to the number of code units encoded into `buf_`; and sets
`buf_index_` to `buf_last_ - 1`, or to `0` if this is an `or_error` view and
we read an invalid subsequence.

If the view is an `or_error` view that encountered an invalid subsequence,
that subsequence becomes a single `value_type` set to a
`utf_transcoding_error` enumerator in the output range. The value of the
enumerator corresponds to the underlying range's input subsequences as
follows. (All ranges of numerical values of code units below are inclusive.)

- If the encoding corresponding to `@*from-type*@` is UTF-8:

  - If the current input subsequence is a code unit between 0x80 and 0xBF,
    the error is `unexpected_utf8_continuation_byte`.
  - If the current input subsequence is a code unit between 0xC0 and 0xC2, or
    between 0xF5 and 0xFF, the error is `invalid_utf8_leading_byte`.
  - If the current input subsequence is 0xE0, and the subsequent input
    subsequence is between 0x80 and 0x9F; or if the current input subsequence
    is 0xF0, and the subsequent input subsequence is between 0x80 and 0x8F;
    then the error is `overlong`.
  - If the current input subsequence is 0xED, and the subsequent input
    subsequence is between 0xA0 and 0xBF, then the error is
    `encoded_surrogate`.
  - If the the current input subsequence is 0xF4, and the subsequent input
    subsequence is between 0x90 and 0xBF, then the error is `out_of_range`
  - Otherwise, if the current input subsequence is invalid UTF-8, begins with
    a code unit between 0xC2 and 0xF4, and there exists some hypothetical
    sequence of code units which would make the current input subsequence
    well-formed if concatenated to the end of it, then the error is
    `truncated_utf8_sequence`.

- If the encoding corresponding to `@*from-type*@` is UTF-16:

  - If the current input subsequence is between 0xD800 and 0xDBFF, the error
    is `unpaired_high_surrogate`.
  - If the current input subsequence is between 0xDC00 and 0xDFFF, the error
    is `unpaired_low_surrogate`.

- If the encoding corresponding to `@*from-type*@` is UTF-32:

  - If the current input subsequence is between 0xD800 and 0xDFFF, the error
    is `encoded_surrogate`.
  - If the current input subsequence is between 0x110000 and 0xFFFFFFFF,
    the error is `out_of_range`.

The exposition-only member function `@*success*@` returns `false` if the
current input subsequence is invalid, `true` otherwise.

`@*utf-iterator*@`'s exposition-only type alias `@*innermost-iter*@` is
`@*iter*@::@*innermost-iter*@` if `@*iter*@` is
`@*to_utf_view_iterator_optimizable*@`, or `@*iter*@` otherwise. The
exposition-only type alias `@*innermost-sent*@` is
`@*sent*@::@*innermost-sent*@` if `@*sent*@` is
`@*to_utf_view_iterator_optimizable*@`, or `@*sent*@` otherwise.

If `@*utf-iterator*@` is a `bidirectional_iterator`, it is defined to be at
the beginning of its underlying range if `buf_index_` is zero and
`curr() == begin()`. If it is a `forward_iterator`, it is defined to be at the
end of its underlying range if `buf_index_ + 1 == buf_last_` and
`curr() == last_`. Otherwise, it is defined to be at the end of its underlying
range if `buf_index_ == buf_last_` and `curr() == last_`.

If `operator*` or `operator++` are invoked while `@*utf-iterator*@` is at the
end of its underlying range, the behavior is undefined; if `operator--` is
invoked while `@*utf-iterator*@` is at the beginning of its underlying range,
the behavior is undefined.

`to_utf8_view` produces a view of the UTF-8 code units transcoded from the
elements of a `@*utf-range*@`. `to_utf16_view` produces a view of the UTF-16
code units transcoded from the elements of a `@*utf-range*@`. `to_utf32_view`
produces a view of the UTF-32 code units transcoded from the elements of a
`@*utf-range*@`. Their `or_error` equivalents produce a view of
`expected<charN_t, utf_transcoding_error>` where invalid input subsequences
result in errors.

The names `to_utf8`, `to_utf8_or_error`, `to_utf16`, `to_utf16_or_error`,
`to_utf32`, and `to_utf32_or_error` denote range adaptor objects
([range.adaptor.object]). `to_utf` and `to_utf_or_error` denote range adaptor
object templates. `to_utfN` produces `to_utfN_view`s, and `to_utfN_or_error`
produces `to_utfN_or_error_view`s. `to_utf<ToType>` is equivalent to `to_utf8`
if `ToType` is `char8_t`, `to_utf16` if `ToType` is `char16_t`, and `to_utf32`
if `ToType` is `char32_t`, and similarly for `to_utf_or_error`. Let `to_utfN`
denote any of the aforementioned range adaptor objects, let `Char` be its
corresponding character type, and let `V` denote the `to_utfN_view` or
2`to_utfN_or_error_view` associated with that object. Let `E` be an expression
and let `T` be `remove_cvref_t<decltype((E))>`. If `decltype((E))` does not
model `@*utf-range*@`, `to_utfN(E)` is ill-formed. The expression `to_utfN(E)`
is expression-equivalent to:

- If `E` is a specialization of `empty_view` ([range.empty.view]), then
  `empty_view<Char>{}`.

- Otherwise, if `T` is an array type of known bound, then:

  - If the array extent is nonzero and the last element of the array is zero,
    then
    `V(std::ranges::subrange(std::ranges::begin(E), --std::ranges::end(E)))`
  - Otherwise,
    `V(std::ranges::subrange(std::ranges::begin(E), std::ranges::end(E)))`

- Otherwise, `V(std::views::all(E))`

The implementation of the `empty()` member function provided by the
transcoding views is more efficient than the one provided by `view_interface`,
since `view_interface`'s implementation will construct `utf_view::begin()` and
`utf_view::end()` and compare them, whereas we can simply use the underlying
range's `empty()`, since a transcoding view is empty if and only if its
underlying range is empty.

## Code unit adaptors

```
namespace std::ranges::views {

  template<class T>
  struct @*implicit-cast-to*@ {
    constexpr T operator()(auto x) const noexcept { return x; }
  };

  inline constexpr @*unspecified*@ as_char8_t;

  inline constexpr @*unspecified*@ as_char16_t;

  inline constexpr @*unspecified*@ as_char32_t;
}
```

The names `as_char8_t`, `as_char16_t`, and `as_char32_t` denote range adaptor
objects ([range.adaptor.object]). Let `as_charN_t` denote any one of
`as_char8_t`, `as_char16_t`, and `as_char32_t`. Let `Char` be the
corresponding character type for `as_charN_t`, let `E` be an expression and
let `T` be `remove_cvref_t<decltype((E))>`. If `ranges::range_reference_t<T>`
does not model `convertible_to<Char>`, `as_charN_t(E)` is ill-formed. The
expression `as_charN_t(E)` is expression-equivalent to:

- If `T` is a specialization of `empty_view` ([range.empty.view]), then
  `empty_view<Char>{}`.

- Otherwise, if `T` is an array type of known bound, then:

  - If the array extent is nonzero and the last element of the array is zero,
    then
    `ranges::transform_view(std::ranges::subrange(std::ranges::begin(E), --std::ranges::end(E)), @*implicit-cast-to*@<Char>{})`
  - Otherwise,
    `ranges::transform_view(std::ranges::subrange(std::ranges::begin(E), std::ranges::end(E)), @*implicit-cast-to*@<Char>{})`

- Otherwise, `ranges::transform_view(std::views::all(E), @*implicit-cast-to*@<Char>{})`


\[Example 1:
```c++
std::vector<int> path_as_ints = {U'C', U':', U'\x00010000'};
std::filesystem::path path = path_as_ints | as_char32_t | std::ranges::to<std::u32string>();
auto const& native_path = path.native();
if (native_path != std::wstring{L'C', L':', L'\xD800', L'\xDC00'}) {
  return false;
}
```

# Changelog

## Changes since R7

- Add playing card example
- Remove `iterator_interface` from `@*utf-iterator*@`
- Replace code unit views with range adaptor closure objects that are
  expression-equivalent to P3117 `transform_view`
- Move `null_sentinel` and `null_term` into P3705
- Remove `std::uc` namespace and replace it with `std::ranges` and `std::ranges::views`
- Remove library EB

## Changes since R6

- Fix a bug in `null_sentinel_t` causing it not to satisfy `sentinel_for` by
  changing its `operator==` to return `bool`.
- Fix a bug in `null_sentinel_t` where it did not support non-copyable input
  iterators by having operator== take input iterators by reference.
- Rename `as_utfN` to `to_utfN` to emphasize that a conversion is taking place
  and to contrast with the code unit views, which remain named `as_charN_t`.
- Refactor `utf_view` into an exposition-only `@*utf-view-impl*@` class used
  as an implementation detail of separate `to_utf8_view`, `to_utf16_view`, and
  `to_utf32_view` classes, addressing broken deduction guides in the previous
  revision.
- Remove `project_view` and copy most of its implementation into separate
  `char8_view`, `char16_view`, and `char32_view` classes, addressing broken
  deduction guides in the previous revision.
- Change `utf_iterator` to an exposition-only member class of
  `@*utf-view-impl*@`.
- Eliminate iterator unpacking mechanism and replace it with an alternative
  solution to the problem of transcoding ranges wrapping other transcoding
  ranges. This simplifies the API at the expense of removing the transcoding
  iterator's `begin()` and `end()` member functions and losing the ability to
  implement unpacking for user-defined UTF iterators.
- Remove `std::uc::format`.
- Make all concepts exposition-only.
- Remove `utf_transcoding_error_handler` mechanism.
- Introduce new error handling mechanism based on a new `utf_transcoding_error`
  enumeration which is returned by an `success()` member function of the
  transcoding view's iterator.
- Remove ability to pass pointers to range adaptor closure objects, which
  violated the restriction that only ranges may be passed to range adaptor
  closure objects.
- Remove `std::format` and `std::ostream` functionality. It doesn't make sense
  for this mechanism to be the only way we have to format/output `char8_t`; we
  can revisit this functionality when we have already figured out how to
  support e.g. `std::u8string`.
- Replace code examples with new ones reflecting API changes.
- Provide a reference implementation.

## Changes since R5

- Simplify the complicated constraint on the comparison operator for
  `null_sentinel_t`.
- Introduce `ranges::project_view`, and implement `charN_view`s in terms of
  that.
- Convert the `utfN_view`s to aliases, rather than individual classes.

## Changes since R4

- Replace `unpacking_owning_view` with `unpacking_view`, and use it to do
  unpacking, rather than sometimes doing the unpacking in the adaptor.
- Ensure `const` and non-`const` overloads for `begin` and `end` in all views.
- Move `null_sentinel_t` to `std`, remove its `base` member function, and make
  it useful for more than just pointers, based on SG-9 guidance.

## Changes since R3

- Changed the definition of the `code_unit` concept, and added `as_charN_t`
  adaptors.
- Removed the utility functions and Unicode-related constants, except
  `replacement_character`.
- Changed the constraint on `utf_iterator` slightly.
- Change `null_sentinel_t` back to being Unicode-specific.

## Changes since R2

- Add `noexcept` where appropriate.
- Remove non-essential constants and utility functions, and elaborate on the
  usage of the ones that remain.
- Note differences from similar elements proposed in [@P1629R1].
- Extend the examples slightly.
- Correct an error in the description of the view adaptors' semantics, and
  provide several examples of their use.

## Changes since R1

- Reintroduce the transcoding-from-a-buffer example.
- Generalize `null_sentinel_t` to a non-Unicode-specific facility.
- In utility functions that search for ill-formed encoding, take a range
  argument instead of a pair of iterator arguments.
- Replace `utf{8,16,32}_view` with a single `utf_view`.

## Changes since R0

- When naming code points in interfaces, use `char32_t`.
- When naming code units in interfaces, use `charN_t`.
- Remove each eager algorithm, leaving in its corresponding view.
- Remove all the output iterators.
- Change template parameters to `utfN_view` to the types of the from-range,
  instead of the types of the transcoding iterators used to implement the view.
- Remove all make-functions.
- Replace the misbegotten `as_utfN()` functions with the `as_utfN` view
  adaptors that should have been there all along.
- Add missing `utf_transcoding_error_handler` concept.
- Turn `unpack_iterator_and_sentinel` into a CPO.
- Lower the UTF iterator concepts from bidirectional to input.

# Motivation

Unicode is important to many, many users in everyday software. It is not
exotic or weird. Well, it's weird, but it's not weird to see it used. C and
C++ are the only major production languages with essentially no support for
Unicode.

Let's fix.

To fix, first we start with the most basic representations of strings in
Unicode: UTF. You might get a UTF string from anywhere; on Windows you often
get them from the OS, in UTF-16. In web-adjacent applications, strings are
most commonly in UTF-8. In ASCII-only applications, everything is in UTF-8,
by its definition as a superset of ASCII.

Often, an application needs to switch between UTFs: 8 -> 16, 32 -> 16, etc.
In SG-16 we've taken to calling such UTF-N -> UTF-M operations "transcoding".

This paper provides interfaces to do UTF transcoding based on the ranges API.

A particular reason for urgency in adding transcoding operations to the
standard library is that the standard library has previously contained
problematic-to-broken UTF transcoding facilities in the form of `std::codecvt`
facets which are currently slated for removal without replacement as
[@P2871R3] and [@P2873R2] make their way through the committee. GitHub
searches show that these facilities are widely used; the functionality
contained in this paper can serve as a proper replacement.

# The shortest Unicode primer imaginable

There are multiple encoding types defined in Unicode: UTF-8, UTF-16, and
UTF-32.

A *code unit* is the lowest-level datum-type in your Unicode data. Examples
are a `char8_t` in UTF-8 and a `char32_t` in UTF-32.

A *code point* is a 32-bit integral value that represents a single Unicode
value. Examples are U+0041 "A" "LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A" and U+0308 "¨"
"COMBINING DIAERESIS".

A code point may be consist of multiple code units. For instance, 3 UTF-8
code units in sequence may encode a particular code point.

# Basic examples

## Transcoding a UTF-8 string literal to a `std::u32string`

```cpp
std::u32string hello_world =
  u8"こんにちは世界" | std::views::to_utf32 | std::ranges::to<std::u32string>();
```

## Sanitizing potentially invalid Unicode

Here, we sanitize potentially invalid Unicode C strings by replacing invalid
code units with replacement characters according to Unicode's recommended
Substitution of Maximal Subparts:

```cpp
template <typename CharT>
std::basic_string<CharT> sanitize(CharT const* str) {
  return std::null_term(str) | std::views::to_utf<CharT> | std::ranges::to<std::basic_string<CharT>>();
}
```

## Returning the final non-ASCII code point in a string, transcoding backwards lazily:

```cpp
std::optional<char32_t> last_nonascii(std::ranges::view auto str) {
  for (auto c : str | std::views::to_utf32 | std::views::reverse
                    | std::views::filter([](char32_t c) { return c > 0x7f; })
                    | std::views::take(1)) {
    return c;
  }
  return std::nullopt;
}
```

## Transcoding strings and throwing a descriptive exception on invalid UTF

(This example assumes the existence of the `enum_to_string` sample function from
[@P2996R5])

```cpp
template <typename FromChar, typename ToChar>
std::basic_string<ToChar> transcode_or_throw(std::basic_string_view<FromChar> input) {
  std::basic_string<ToChar> result;
  auto view = input | to_utf<ToChar>;
  for (auto it = view.begin(), end = view.end(); it != end; ++it) {
    if (it.success()) {
      result.push_back(*it);
    } else {
      throw std::runtime_error("error at position " +
                               std::to_string(it.base() - input.begin()) + ": " +
                               enum_to_string(it.success().error()));
    }
  }
  return result;
}
```

## Changing the suits of Unicode playing card characters:

```
enum class suit : std::uint8_t {
  spades = 0xA,
  hearts = 0xB,
  diamonds = 0xC,
  clubs = 0xD
};

// Unicode playing card characters are laid out such that changing the second least
// significant nibble changes the suit, e.g.
// U+1F0A1 PLAYING CARD ACE OF SPADES
// U+1F0B1 PLAYING CARD ACE OF HEARTS
constexpr char32_t change_playing_card_suit(char32_t card, suit s) {
  if (U'\N{PLAYING CARD ACE OF SPADES}' <= card && card <= U'\N{PLAYING CARD KING OF CLUBS}') {
    return (card & ~(0xF << 4)) | (static_cast<std::uint8_t>(s) << 4);
  }
  return card;
}

void change_playing_card_suits() {
  std::u8string_view const spades = u8"🂡🂢🂣🂤🂥🂦🂧🂨🂩🂪🂫🂭🂮";
  std::u8string const hearts =
    spades |
    to_utf32 |
    std::views::transform(std::bind_back(change_playing_card_suit, suit::hearts)) |
    to_utf8 |
    std::ranges::to<std::u8string>();
  assert(hearts == u8"🂱🂲🂳🂴🂵🂶🂷🂸🂹🂺🂻🂽🂾");
}
```

## Adapting a range of non-character-type values

Let's say that we want to take code points that we got from ICU, and transcode
them to UTF-8. The problem is that ICU's code point type is `int`. Since `int`
is not a character type, it's not deduced by `to_utf8` to be UTF-32 data. We
can address this by using the `std::views::as_char32_t` to cast the `int`s to
`char32_t`:

```cpp
std::vector<int> input = get_icu_code_points();
// This is ill-formed without the as_char32_t adaptation.
auto input_utf8 =
  input | std::views::as_char32_t | std::views::to_utf8 | std::ranges::to<std::u8string>();
```

# Proposed design

## Dependencies

This proposal depends on the existence of [@P3117R1] "Extending Conditionally Borrowed".

[@P3705R0] "A sentinel for null-terminated strings" is used in some examples, but it isn't
a dependency.

## Discussion of whether transcoding views should accept ranges of `char` and `wchar_t`

Here are some examples of the differences between having the transcoding views
accept ranges of `char` and `wchar_t` or reject them. The `to_utfN` and
`as_charN` adaptors are discussed later in this paper.

The `to_utfN` adaptors produce `to_utfN_view`s, which do transcoding.

The `as_charN_t` adaptors produce `as_charN_view`s that are each very similar
to a `transform_view` that casts each element of the adapted range to a
`charN_t` value. An `as_charN_view` differs from the equivalent transform in
that it may be a borrowed range.

Note the use of the shorthand "`charN_t`" below with `std::wstring`. That's
there because whether you write `as_char16_t` or `as_char32_t` is
implementation-dependent.

```

### Accepting ranges of `char` and `wchar_t`
```c++
using namespace std::views;

auto v1  = u8"text" | to_utf32;  // Ok.
auto v2  = u"text"  | to_utf8;   // Ok.
auto v3  = U"text"  | to_utf16;  // Ok.

auto v4  = std::u8string(u8"text") | to_utf32;  // Ok.
auto v5  = std::u16string(u"text") | to_utf8;   // Ok.
auto v6  = std::u32string(U"text") | to_utf16;  // Ok.

auto v7  = std::string  | to_utf32; // Ok.
auto v8  = std::wstring | to_utf8;  // Ok.

auto v9  = std::string  | as_char8_t | to_utf32; // Ok.
auto v10 = std::wstring | as_charN_t | to_utf8;  // Ok.
```

:::

In short, rejecting `char` and `wchar_t` forces you to write "`| as_char8_t`"
everywhere you want to use a `std::string` with the interfaces proposed in
this paper.

SG-16 has previously expressed strong support for rejecting `char` and
`wchar_t`, as can be observed in the polling history section.

The feeling in SG-16 was that the `charN_t` types are designed to represent
UTF encodings, and `char` is not. A `char const *` string could be in any one
of dozens (hundreds?) of encodings. The addition of "`| as_char8_t`" to adapt
ranges of `char` is meant to act as a lexical indicator of user intent.

The authors believe this decision is a mistake. Our argument for accepting
ranges of `char` and `wchar_t` is as follows.

First, note that none of the `charN_t` types imposes any invariant that a
range of its contents contains valid Unicode. As a result, they cannot enforce
preconditions for APIs that require valid Unicode input at the level of the
type system.

Therefore, we claim that the main use case of the `charN_t` types in APIs is
to facilitate a coding style that allows APIs to advertise to users whether
they expect Unicode-encoded strings (whether with a wide or a narrow
contract).

For example, users of this coding style may write an API like the following:

```cpp
// Expect input to be in Windows-1252
std::size_t word_count(std::string_view);

// Expect input to be in Unicode
std::size_t word_count(std::u8string_view);
```

If `to_utfN` rejects ranges of `char` and `wchar_t`, it would bring this
standard library API into alignment with this style.

However, there are a number of reasons why we consider this approach
undesirable for our use case.

First of all, for any large C++ API surface dealing with Unicode that was not
designed very recently, there will be APIs that expect UTF-8 in the form of
`std::string` parameters. This means that the semantic value of `char8_t` is
one-sided; in such an ecosystem, while the presence of `char8_t` certainly
indicates that the API expects UTF-8, the absence of `char8_t` may still
indicate a `char`-based API that also expects UTF-8.

Furthermore, because `char8_t` is such a recent addition to the standard, and
because it's so poorly supported by other standard library facilities such as
`<iostream>` and `std::format`, its penetration has been extremely low; a
Github Code Search showed 15.3M references to `std::string` and 6.7k
references to `std::u8string`.

Finally, due to the particular history of implementation choices by compiler
writers, the proportion of C++ users who have the ability to properly benefit
from the use of `char8_t` is unfortunately smaller than intended.

For the vast majority of users of Unix-like operating systems, both the basic
literal encoding and the execution encoding are UTF-8, and so `char8_t` is
mostly redundant, since it has approximately the same meaning as `char`. This
leaves Windows developers as the remaining large pool of users who could
potentially take advantage of `char8_t`.

The issue is that Windows users are divided into two categories: those who use
MSVC's `/utf8` compiler flag, and those who do not.

Users of `/utf8` are in the future: `/utf8` switches the basic literal
encoding and execution encoding to UTF-8. These users have less need for
`char8_t` because their `char`s are UTF-8.

Non-users of `/utf8` are dealing with non-Unicode basic literal and execution
encodings, so theoretically they're the target audience for `char8_t`. But
unfortunately, without the `/utf8` flag, MSVC breaks compliance with the
standard, in that it violates the requirement that `u8""` string literals are
encoded in Unicode. Attempting to create such a string literal on MSVC without
specifying `/utf8` results in Windows-1252 code units inside of `char8_t`
bytes. For these users, `char8_t` is theoretically useful but broken in
practice.

Rejecting `char` and `wchar_t` for UTF transcoding will therefore have
limited benefits. On the other hand, rejecting these types will send users
over to Stack Overflow to discover they need to copy boilerplate called
`| std::views::as_char8_t` for reasons that will seem academic to most of them.

## Error handling mechanism

When invalid code units are encountered, the UTF transcoding views replace
those code units with U+FFFD replacement characters according to the Unicode
standard's recommended "Substitution of Maximal Subparts" algorithm.

However, users of the transcoding views may want to know when invalid code
units have been encountered, and to implement custom behaviors if this is the
case. Simply checking whether the transcoded code points contain U+FFFD
replacement characters is not sufficient because these characters are an
in-band signal that can also appear in valid UTF.

What's called for is a basis operation with which arbitrary error handling
approaches may be implemented.

The UTF transcoding views in this paper provide such a basis operation by
adding an `success()` member function to the iterator of the transcoding view,
which informs users whether the current code point is a U+FFFD that was
inserted in response to an invalid code unit sequence. The `success()` member
function returns a `std::expected<void, std::utf_transcoding_error>`, where
`std::utf_transcoding_error` is a new enum class containing enumerators for
every category of transcoding error.

Users who choose not to implement error handling will simply sanitize any
invalid code unit sequences using U+FFFD replacement. Users who want to
implement error handling can implement any of the following approaches, either
by wrapping the iterator or by iterating with a traditional for loop:

- Throwing an exception
- Using an character other than U+FFFD for replacing invalid code units
- Dropping illegal code units
- Producing an error log message
- Collecting statistics on transcoding errors
- Implementing a custom transcoding view whose `value_type` is
  `std::expected<charN_t, std::utf_transcoding_error>`

### Why `std::expected<void, E>`?

The main alternative to consider here would be to specify that
default-constructed `std::utf_transcoding_error` values represent success, or
add a `success` enumerator whose value is zero. There is precedent for doing
this in the standard in the error handling approach of `std::from_chars`,
which returns a `std::from_chars_result` containing a `std::errc` that has an
`operator bool()` that returns `true` if the `std::errc` is
default-constructed.

However, that design decision was made before `std::expected` was added to the
standard library in C++23. Now that we have this facility, we should take the
opportunity to use the type system to structurally separate the error cases
from the success cases, instead of lumping them all together in the same type
as in the case of `std::errc`.

### Existing practice

- [`iconv()`](https://www.gnu.org/savannah-checkouts/gnu/libiconv/documentation/libiconv-1.17/iconv.3.html)
  - Uses two possible `errno` error codes:
    - `EINVAL` (the initial subsequence of a valid sequence was at the end of the
      input sequence)
    - `EILSEQ` (any other invalid sequence in the input)
  - Uses an out-parameter to point to the beginning of the invalid sequence
- ICU
  - [`u_strFromUTF8WithSub()`](https://unicode-org.github.io/icu-docs/apidoc/released/icu4c/ustring_8h.html#a8fd0b27d2f87358cb5730ce6952af9a6)
    - Either replaces invalid input sequences with a user-provided `int32_t`
      (documentation recommends U+FFFD) or sets an error code using an
      out-param
- [MultiByteToWideChar()](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/stringapiset/nf-stringapiset-multibytetowidechar)
  - User specifies a flag to decide whether to fail on invalid input
  - If set, any invalid input results in the error code
    `ERROR_NO_UNICODE_TRANSLATION`
  - If unset, uses U+FFFD replacement (unless pre-Vista in which case illegal
    sequences are dropped)
- Python [`decode()`](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/unicode.html)
  - Invalid sequences result in exceptions containing verbose descriptions of
    the offending sequence
  - Example:
    ```
    >>> b'\x80abc'.decode("utf-8", "strict")
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
    UnicodeDecodeError: 'utf-8' codec can't decode byte 0x80 in position 0:
      invalid start byte
    ```
  - List of error messages:
    - `unexpected end of data`
    - `invalid start byte`
    - `invalid continuation byte`
    - `code point in surrogate code point range(0xd800, 0xe000)`
    - `truncated data`
    - `code point not in range(0x110000)`
    - `illegal encoding`
    - `illegal UTF-16 surrogate`

The claim that `to_utfN_view`'s `success()` API is a basis operation is
supported by the fact that each of the above APIs can be implemented using it,
but not vice versa. See [Appendix: Implementing Existing Practice for Error
Handling](#appendix-implementing-existing-practice-for-error-handling) for
code examples which demonstrate this.

### `std::utf_transcoding_error` enumerators

- `truncated_utf8_sequence`
    - An ill-formed subsequence that matches the beginning of some well-formed
      sequence.
    - Example invalid code unit sequence: UTF-8 `0xE1 0x80`.
- `unpaired_high_surrogate`
    - Example invalid code unit sequence: UTF-16 `0xD800`.
- `unpaired_low_surrogate`
    - Example invalid code unit sequence: UTF-16 `0xDC00`.
- `unexpected_utf8_continuation_byte`
    - Example invalid code unit sequence: UTF-8 `0x80`.
- `overlong`
    - An overlong UTF-8 encoding.
    - Example invalid code unit sequence: UTF-8 `0xE0 0x80`.
- `encoded_surrogate`
    - Applies to both UTF-8 and UTF-32.
    - Example invalid code unit sequence: UTF-8 `0xED 0xA0`, UTF-32
      `0x0000D800`.
- `out_of_range`
    - Applies to both UTF-8 and UTF-32
    - In UTF-8, this applies to `0xF4` if it is followed by a continuation
      byte greater than `0x8F`
    - In UTF-32, this is any code unit greater than `0x10FFFF`
    - Example invalid code unit sequence: UTF-8 `0xF4 0x90`, UTF-32
      `0x110000`.
- `invalid_utf8_leading_byte`
    - In UTF-8, this applies to `0xC0`-`0xC1` and `0xF5`-`0xFF`.
    - Example invalid code unit sequence: UTF-8 `0xC0`.

An alternative approach to minimize the number of enumerators could merge
`truncated_utf8_sequence` with `unpaired_high_surrogate` and merge
`unexpected_utf8_continuation_byte` with `unpaired_low_surrogate`, but based
on feedback, splitting these up seems to be preferred.

### Examples

The first two rows of each of the following tables are taken directly from the
"U+FFFD Substitution of Maximal Subparts" section of the Unicode standard, and
augmented to show the associated `success()` for each resulting code point.

Note that outside of the truncation case, the leading code unit is associated
with a more specific error enumerator, and then all the continuation bytes in
the invalid sequence are `unexpected_utf8_continuation_byte`. This is aligned
with my interpretation of the underlying logic of Substitution of Maximal
Subparts; also, any other approach would require additional lookahead, which
would break some of the API's invariants.

## Optimization for transcoding views wrapping other transcoding views

In generic contexts, users will create `to_utfN_view`s wrapping iterators of
other `to_utfN_view`s. This presents a problem for a naive implementation
because when `to_utfN_view` is wrapping a bidirectional range, the number of
iterators in each successive `to_utfN_view` wrapper increases geometrically
unless we use workarounds.

The workaround makes it so that when a `to_utfN_view` is constructed from
another `to_utfN_view`'s iterators, instead of storing those iterators in the
iterators of the outer `to_utfN_view`, the outer `to_utfN_view`'s iterators have
identical contents to the inner `to_utfN_view`'s iterators, the only difference
being the output encoding. This also allows the outer `to_utfN_view`'s
iterators to reconstruct the inner `to_utfN_view` iterator when its `base()`
member function is invoked, without actually storing it.

This optimization is only needed when the underlying range is bidirectional
(or "better"), because input ranges and forward ranges increase in size
linearly rather than geometrically with each successive wrapper, due to the
fact that the sentinel is not wrapped by the transcoding iterator.

Although it's not strictly necessary, we could also apply the optimization
when the underlying range is a forward range, preventing the iterator size
from growing at all (as opposed to linear growth), but that isn't done in this
paper because we judge the tradeoffs as not being justified. It is not
possible to apply the optimization when the underlying range is an input
range, because of the fact that the underlying iterator is past-the-end of the
current code point.

The diagram below represents the outcome of the following process:

- The user starts with a range of `char8_t`s from `0x100` to `0x300`.
- They create a `to_utf16_view` with this underlying range.
- They advance that view's `begin()` iterator until the underlying pointer is
  at `0x150` and reverse the view's `end()` iterator until the underlying
  pointer is at `0x250`.
- They create a subrange with these iterators and wrap it in a
  `to_utf32_view`.
- They advance the `to_utf32_view`'s `begin()` iterator until the underlying
  pointer (two levels down) is at `0x175` and similarly reverse `end()` to
  `0x225`.

The goal is for the optimized implementation to avoid having to store all the
iterators that the naive implementation does, while still outwardly appearing
to the user as though its API is the same as the naive one.

The iterators of the optimized `to_utf32_view` can simulate the naive
version's `base()` by reconstructing a `to_utf16_view` iterator containing its
own `first`, `curr`, and `last` iterators. However, if we added accessors for
`first()` and `last()` to the iterator, then we wouldn't be able to return the
same results as the naive implementation because we've lost information about
those iterators-- so this optimization can only work properly if we leave
those out.

Unlike with other range adaptor objects, `base()` cannot have any overloads
that simply return a reference to the underlying iterator as opposed to a new
copy or move-constructed instantiation of it, because of this optimization.

Input iterators cannot benefit from this optimization because they are
necessarily past-the-end of the current code point within the range being
adapted, whereas other iterator types are at the beginning of the current code
point.

There is an unavoidable inconsistency introduced by this optimization that
occurs when one of the iterators is in the middle of a code point in a
variable length encoding (UTF-8 or UTF-16). Consider what happens when a user
attempts to convert the UTF-32 code point `U+1F574 🕴 MAN IN BUSINESS SUIT
LEVITATING` to UTF-8 and then to UTF-16, but increments the iterator of the
UTF-8 transcoding view by one code unit first.

In the naive implementation, the result is simply three replacement characters
as the UTF-16 transcoder encounters three unexpected UTF-8 continuation bytes:

```
UTF-32: 0x1F574
UTF-8:  0xF0    0x9F   0x95   0xB4
                ^
UTF-16:         0xFFFD 0xFFFD 0xFFFD
```

However, in the optimized implementation, when the UTF-16 transcoding view
wraps the iterator from the UTF-8 transcoding view, it looks directly at the
underlying UTF-32 iterator and forgets the UTF-8 iterator's position within
the code point:

```
UTF-32: 0x1F574
UTF-16: 0xD83D 0xDD74
```

Furthermore, when you invoke `base()` on an iterator of the UTF-16 transcoding
view, it's lost the intra-code-point position, moving it back to the starting
code unit:

```
Original iterator:
UTF-8:  0xF0    0x9F   0x95   0xB4
                ^

Result of base():
UTF-8:  0xF0    0x9F   0x95   0xB4
        ^
```

These inconsistencies are somewhat unfortunate, but they only apply when the
input to the transcoding view starts in the middle of a code point, which is
definitionally invalid UTF anyway; and it does not affect the invariant that
the output is always valid UTF. This is an acceptable tradeoff for avoiding
quadratic growth of the iterator sizes.


It's a useful property of this approach that the type system remembers the
correct type to use for `base()` even in the case of transcoding views
wrapping other transcoding view. To illustrate, consider this algorithm (not
proposed) as an example.

```c++
template<input_iterator I, sentinel_for<I> S, output_iterator<char8_t> O>
transcode_result<I, O> transcode_to_utf32(I first, S last, O out);
```

Such a transcoding algorithm is pretty similar to `std::ranges::copy`, in that
you should return both the output iterator *and* the final position of the
input iterator (`transcode_result` is an alias for `in_out_result`). Because
we can always provide `base()`, we have no trouble returning a
`transcode_result` here in every case:

```
template<input_iterator I, sentinel_for<I> S, output_iterator<char8_t> O>
transcode_result<I, O> transcode_to_utf32(I first, S last, O out) {
    auto r = ranges::subrange(first, last) | views::as_utf32;

    auto copy_result = ranges::copy(r, out);

    return transcode_result<I, O>{copy_result.in.base(), copy_result.out};
}
```

## Other design notes

None of the proposed interfaces is subject to change in future versions of
Unicode; each relates to the guaranteed-stable subset. Just sayin'.

None of the proposed interfaces allocates or throws.

All the transcoding iterators allow you access to the underlying iterator via
`.base()`, following the convention of the iterator adaptors already in the
standard.

The transcoding views are lazy, as you'd expect. They also compose with the
standard view adaptors, so just transcoding at most 10 UTF-16 code units out
of some UTF can be done with `foo | std::views::to_utf16 |
std::ranges::views::take(10)`.

Error handling strategies of the user's choosing can be implemented by the
user due to the suitable basis operation `success()` provided by the transcoding
iterator. This gives control to those who want to do something other than the
default. The default, according to Unicode, is to produce a replacement
character (`0xfffd`) in the output when broken UTF encoding is seen in the
input. This is what all these interfaces do, unless you make use of the basis
operation.

The production of replacement characters as error-handling strategy is good
for memory compactness and safety. It allows us to store all our text as
UTF-8 (or, less compactly, as UTF-16), and then process code points as
transcoding views. If an error occurs, the transcoding views will simply
produce a replacement character; there is no danger of UB.

The exposition-only concept `@*to-utf-view-iterator-optimizable*@` is true if
its template parameter is a specialization of `@*utf-iterator*@` and it is a
`@*std::ranges::bidirectional_iterator*@`.

`@*to-utf-view-impl*@` is an exposition-only class that provides
implementation details common to the six transcoding views, `to_utf8_view`,
`to_utf8_or_error_view`, `to_utf16_view`, `to_utf16_or_error_view`,
`to_utf32_view`, and `to_utf32_or_error_view`, which are themselves described
further down.

The iterator type of `@*to-utf-view-impl*@` is
`@*utf-iterator*@`. `@*utf-iterator*@` is an iterator that transcodes from
UTF-N to UTF-M, where N and M are each one of 8, 16, or 32. N may equal
M.

`@*utf-iterator*@` uses a mapping between character types and UTF encodings,
which is that that `char` and `char8_t` correspond to UTF-8, `char16_t`
corresponds to UTF-16, `char32_t` corresponds to UTF-32, and `wchar_t`
corresponds to UTF-16 if its size is two or UTF-32 if its size is 4.

`@*utf-iterator*@` does its work by adapting an underlying range of code
units. We use the term "input subsequence" to refer to a potentially
ill-formed code unit subsequence which is to be transcoded into a code point
`c`. Each input subsequence is decoded from the UTF encoding corresponding to
`@*from-type*@`. If the underlying range contains ill-formed UTF, the code
units are divided into input subsequences according to Substitution of Maximal
Subparts, and each ill-formed input subsequence is transcoded into a
`U+FFFD`. `c` is then encoded to `ToType`'s corresponding encoding, into an
internal code unit buffer.

`@*utf-iterator*@` maintains certain invariants; the invariants differ based
on whether `@*utf-iterator*@` is an input iterator.

For input iterators the invariant is: if `*this` is at the end of the range
being adapted, then `curr()` == `last_`; otherwise, the position of `curr()`
is always at the end of the input subsequence corresponding to the current
code point `c`, and `buf_` contains the code units that comprise `c`, in the
UTF encoding corresponding to `ToType`.

For forward and bidirectional iterators, the invariant is: if `*this` is at
the end of the range being adapted, then `curr()` == `last_`; otherwise, the
position of `curr()` is always at the beginning of the input subsequence
corresponding to the current code point `c` within the underlying range,
and `buf_` contains the code units in `ToFormat` that comprise `c`.

The exposition-only member function `read` decodes the input subsequence
starting at position `curr()` into a code point `c`, using the UTF encoding
corresponding to `@*from-type*@`, and setting `c` to U+FFFD if the input
subsequence is ill-formed. If `c` is set to U+FFFD as the result of an
ill-formed input subsequence, it sets the error as described below. It sets
`to_increment_` to the number of code units read while decoding `c`; encodes
`c` into `buf_` in the UTF encoding corresponding to `ToType`; sets
`buf_index_` to `0`; and sets `buf_last_` to the number of code units encoded
into `buf_`. If `forward_iterator<I>` is `true`, `curr()` is set to the
position it had before `read` was called.

The exposition-only member function `read_reverse` decodes the input
subsequence ending at position `curr()` into a code point `c`, using the UTF
encoding corresponding to `@*from-type*@`, and setting `c` to U+FFFD if the
input subsequence is ill-formed. If `c` is set to U+FFFD as the result of an
ill-formed input subsequence, it sets the error as described below.  It sets
`to_increment_` to the number of code units read while decoding `c`; encodes
`c` into `buf_` in the UTF encoding corresponding to `ToType`; sets
`buf_last_` to the number of code units encoded into `buf_`; and sets
`buf_index_` to `buf_last_ - 1`, or to `0` if this is an `or_error` view and
we read an invalid subsequence.

If the view is an `or_error` view that encountered an invalid subsequence,
that subsequence becomes a single `value_type` set to a
`utf_transcoding_error` enumerator in the output range. The value of the
enumerator corresponds to the underlying range's input subsequences as
follows. (All ranges of numerical values of code units below are inclusive.)

- If the encoding corresponding to `@*from-type*@` is UTF-8:

  - If the current input subsequence is a code unit between 0x80 and 0xBF,
    the error is `unexpected_utf8_continuation_byte`.
  - If the current input subsequence is a code unit between 0xC0 and 0xC2, or
    between 0xF5 and 0xFF, the error is `invalid_utf8_leading_byte`.
  - If the current input subsequence is 0xE0, and the subsequent input
    subsequence is between 0x80 and 0x9F; or if the current input subsequence
    is 0xF0, and the subsequent input subsequence is between 0x80 and 0x8F;
    then the error is `overlong`.
  - If the current input subsequence is 0xED, and the subsequent input
    subsequence is between 0xA0 and 0xBF, then the error is
    `encoded_surrogate`.
  - If the the current input subsequence is 0xF4, and the subsequent input
    subsequence is between 0x90 and 0xBF, then the error is `out_of_range`
  - Otherwise, if the current input subsequence is invalid UTF-8, begins with
    a code unit between 0xC2 and 0xF4, and there exists some hypothetical
    sequence of code units which would make the current input subsequence
    well-formed if concatenated to the end of it, then the error is
    `truncated_utf8_sequence`.

- If the encoding corresponding to `@*from-type*@` is UTF-16:

  - If the current input subsequence is between 0xD800 and 0xDBFF, the error
    is `unpaired_high_surrogate`.
  - If the current input subsequence is between 0xDC00 and 0xDFFF, the error
    is `unpaired_low_surrogate`.

- If the encoding corresponding to `@*from-type*@` is UTF-32:

  - If the current input subsequence is between 0xD800 and 0xDFFF, the error
    is `encoded_surrogate`.
  - If the current input subsequence is between 0x110000 and 0xFFFFFFFF,
    the error is `out_of_range`.

The exposition-only member function `@*success*@` returns `false` if the
current input subsequence is invalid, `true` otherwise.

`@*utf-iterator*@`'s exposition-only type alias `@*innermost-iter*@` is
`@*iter*@::@*innermost-iter*@` if `@*iter*@` is
`@*to_utf_view_iterator_optimizable*@`, or `@*iter*@` otherwise. The
exposition-only type alias `@*innermost-sent*@` is
`@*sent*@::@*innermost-sent*@` if `@*sent*@` is
`@*to_utf_view_iterator_optimizable*@`, or `@*sent*@` otherwise.

If `@*utf-iterator*@` is a `bidirectional_iterator`, it is defined to be at
the beginning of its underlying range if `buf_index_` is zero and
`curr() == begin()`. If it is a `forward_iterator`, it is defined to be at the
end of its underlying range if `buf_index_ + 1 == buf_last_` and
`curr() == last_`. Otherwise, it is defined to be at the end of its underlying
range if `buf_index_ == buf_last_` and `curr() == last_`.

If `operator*` or `operator++` are invoked while `@*utf-iterator*@` is at the
end of its underlying range, the behavior is undefined; if `operator--` is
invoked while `@*utf-iterator*@` is at the beginning of its underlying range,
the behavior is undefined.

`to_utf8_view` produces a view of the UTF-8 code units transcoded from the
elements of a `@*utf-range*@`. `to_utf16_view` produces a view of the UTF-16
code units transcoded from the elements of a `@*utf-range*@`. `to_utf32_view`
produces a view of the UTF-32 code units transcoded from the elements of a
`@*utf-range*@`. Their `or_error` equivalents produce a view of
`expected<charN_t, utf_transcoding_error>` where invalid input subsequences
result in errors.

The names `to_utf8`, `to_utf8_or_error`, `to_utf16`, `to_utf16_or_error`,
`to_utf32`, and `to_utf32_or_error` denote range adaptor objects
([range.adaptor.object]). `to_utf` and `to_utf_or_error` denote range adaptor
object templates. `to_utfN` produces `to_utfN_view`s, and `to_utfN_or_error`
produces `to_utfN_or_error_view`s. `to_utf<ToType>` is equivalent to `to_utf8`
if `ToType` is `char8_t`, `to_utf16` if `ToType` is `char16_t`, and `to_utf32`
if `ToType` is `char32_t`, and similarly for `to_utf_or_error`. Let `to_utfN`
denote any of the aforementioned range adaptor objects, let `Char` be its
corresponding character type, and let `V` denote the `to_utfN_view` or
2`to_utfN_or_error_view` associated with that object. Let `E` be an expression
and let `T` be `remove_cvref_t<decltype((E))>`. If `decltype((E))` does not
model `@*utf-range*@`, `to_utfN(E)` is ill-formed. The expression `to_utfN(E)`
is expression-equivalent to:

- If `E` is a specialization of `empty_view` ([range.empty.view]), then
  `empty_view<Char>{}`.

- Otherwise, if `T` is an array type of known bound, then:

  - If the array extent is nonzero and the last element of the array is zero,
    then
    `V(std::ranges::subrange(std::ranges::begin(E), --std::ranges::end(E)))`
  - Otherwise,
    `V(std::ranges::subrange(std::ranges::begin(E), std::ranges::end(E)))`

- Otherwise, `V(std::views::all(E))`

The implementation of the `empty()` member function provided by the
transcoding views is more efficient than the one provided by `view_interface`,
since `view_interface`'s implementation will construct `utf_view::begin()` and
`utf_view::end()` and compare them, whereas we can simply use the underlying
range's `empty()`, since a transcoding view is empty if and only if its
underlying range is empty.

## Add code unit adaptors

```
namespace std::ranges::views {

  template<class T>
  struct @*implicit-cast-to*@ {
    constexpr T operator()(auto x) const noexcept { return x; }
  };

  inline constexpr @*unspecified*@ as_char8_t;

  inline constexpr @*unspecified*@ as_char16_t;

  inline constexpr @*unspecified*@ as_char32_t;
}
```

The names `as_char8_t`, `as_char16_t`, and `as_char32_t` denote range adaptor
objects ([range.adaptor.object]). Let `as_charN_t` denote any one of
`as_char8_t`, `as_char16_t`, and `as_char32_t`. Let `Char` be the corresponding
character type for `as_charN_t`, let `E` be an expression and let `T` be
`remove_cvref_t<decltype((E))>`. If `ranges::range_reference_t<T>` does not
model `convertible_to<Char>`, `as_charN_t(E)` is ill-formed. The expression
`as_charN_t(E)` is expression-equivalent to:

- If `T` is a specialization of `empty_view` ([range.empty.view]), then
  `empty_view<Char>{}`.

- Otherwise, if `T` is an array type of known bound, then:

  - If the array extent is nonzero and the last element of the array is zero,
    then
    `ranges::transform_view(std::ranges::subrange(std::ranges::begin(E), --std::ranges::end(E)), @*implicit-cast-to*@<Char>{})`
  - Otherwise,
    `ranges::transform_view(std::ranges::subrange(std::ranges::begin(E), std::ranges::end(E)), @*implicit-cast-to*@<Char>{})`

- Otherwise, `ranges::transform_view(std::views::all(E), @*implicit-cast-to*@<Char>{})`


\[Example 1:
```c++
std::vector<int> path_as_ints = {U'C', U':', U'\x00010000'};
std::filesystem::path path = path_as_ints | as_char32_t | std::ranges::to<std::u32string>();
auto const& native_path = path.native();
if (native_path != std::wstring{L'C', L':', L'\xD800', L'\xDC00'}) {
  return false;
}
```
— end example\]

## Why there are three `to_utfN_view`s views plus `utf_view`, and three `as_charN_t_view`s

The views in `std::ranges` are constrained to accept only `std::ranges::view`
template parameters. However, they accept `std::ranges::viewable_range`s in
practice, because they each have a deduction guide that looks like this:

```c++
template<class R>
to_utf8_view(R &&) -> to_utf8_view<views::all_t<R>>;
```

It's not possible to make this work for any view that's a template class that
accepts a template parameter other than the underlying view, because of the
all-or-nothing nature of deduction guides. So we need separate `to_utfN_view`s
and separate `as_charN_t_view`s instead of having them simply be alias
templates for a hypothetical generic `to_utf_view<ToType>` or
`as_charN_t_view<ToType>`, respectively.

## Why `utf_view` always transcodes, even in UTF-N to UTF-N cases

You might expect that if `r` in `r | to_utfN` is already in UTF-N, `r |
to_utfN` might just be `r`. This is not what the `to_utfN` adaptors do,
though.

The adaptors each produce a view `utfv` that stores a view of type
`V`. Further, `utfv.begin()` is always a specialization of
`@*utf-iterator*@`. `utfv.end()` is also a specialization of
`@*utf-iterator*@` (if `common_range<V>`), or otherwise the sentinel value for
`V`.

This gives `r | to_utfN` some nice, consistent properties. With the
exception of `empty_view<T>{} | to_utfN`, the following are always true:

- `r | to_utfN` produces well-formed UTF. This is true even when the input was
  already UTF-N. Remember, the input could have been UTF-N but had ill-formed
  UTF in it.

- `r | to_utfN` has a consistent API. If `r | to_utfN` were sometimes `r`,
  and since `r` may be a reference to an array, you'd have to use
  `std::ranges::begin(r)` and `::end(r)` all the time. However, you'd
  probably write `r.begin()` and `r.end()`, only to one day get bitten by an
  array-reference `r`.

note here that the authors doubt the viability of "a special case for char and

evaluation of a concept change based on the literal encoding seems like a
flaky move; the literal encoding can change TU to TU.

# Implementation experience

The most recent revision of this paper has a reference implementation called
[beman.utf_view](https://github.com/bemanproject/utf_view) available on
GitHub, which is a fork of Jonathan Wakely's implementation of P2728R6 as an
implementation detail for libstdc++. It is part of the Beman project.

Versions of the interfaces provided by previous revisions of this paper have
also been implemented, and re-implemented, several times over the last 5 years
or so, as part of a proposed (but not yet accepted!) Boost library,
[Boost.Text](https://github.com/tzlaine/text). Boost.Text has hundreds of
stars on GitHub.

Both libraries have comprehensive tests.

# Appendix: Implementing Existing Practice for Error Handling

## `iconv`

This function transcodes until it finds an invalid or truncated sequence,
erroring out if so and distinguishing those two cases using errno. It uses an
out-parameter to point to the beginning of the invalid sequence.

```
struct iconv_t {};

// For the sake of simplicity, this iconv only converts between UTF-8 and UTF-32.
size_t iconv(iconv_t cd, const char** inbuf, size_t* inbytesleft, char** outbuf,
             size_t* outbytesleft) {
  if (!inbuf) {
    return 0;
  }
  if (inbuf && !*inbuf) {
    return 0;
  }
  assert(inbytesleft);
  assert(outbuf);

  for (auto it = std::ranges::begin(view), end = std::ranges::end(view); it != end;) {
    if (it.success()) {
      if (*outbytesleft < sizeof(char32_t)) {
        errno = E2BIG;
        return static_cast<std::size_t>(-1);
      }

## ICU `u_strFromUTF8WithSub`

This function transcodes until it finds an invalid sequence and if it does, it
supports either erroring out or producing a substitution character of the
user's choice. It also supports pre-flighting to determine the required output
buffer size, and relying on null termination if the user doesn't supply the
size of the input buffer.

```

  }
}
```

## Windows `MultiByteToWideChar`

This function transcodes until it finds an invalid sequence. If it does, it
will error out if the user provides a flag; if this flag is not provided, the
behavior depends on the OS. Before Windows Vista, it simply drops the invalid
sequences; afterwards, it substitutes with U+FFFD. It also supports
pre-flighting to determine the required output buffer size, and relying on
null termination if the user doesn't supply the size of the input buffer.

```
constexpr int MultiByteToWideChar(unsigned int CodePage, unsigned long dwFlags,
                                  const char* lpMultiByteStr, int cbMultiByte,
                                  wchar_t* lpWideCharStr, int cchWideChar) {

      int chars = 0;
      for (auto it = std::ranges::begin(view); it != end; ++it) {
        chars += it.success() ? 1 : 0;

## Python `decode()`

This is a C++ analog of Python's `decode` function. It accepts a
`std::basic_string_view`, transcodes it from UTF-8, returns a new transcoded
`std::basic_string`, and throws an exception if it encounters invalid UTF
which explains the problem and provides the position of the offending
sequence.

```
template <typename FromChar, typename ToChar>
std::basic_string<ToChar> decode(std::basic_string_view<FromChar> input) {
  std::basic_string<ToChar> result;
  result.reserve(input.size()); // like what size_hint does
  auto view = input | to_utf<ToChar>;
  for (auto it = std::ranges::begin(view), end = std::ranges::end(view); it != end;
       ++it) {
    if (it.success()) {
      result.push_back(*it);
    } else {
      auto pos_curr = it.base() - input.begin();
      auto it2 = it;
      auto pos_next = (++it2).base() - input.begin();
      std::ostringstream ss;
      ss << "can't decode ";
      if (pos_next > pos_curr + 1) {
        ss << "characters";
      } else {
        ss << "character 0x" << std::hex
           << static_cast<unsigned int>(static_cast<unsigned char>(*it.base()))
           << std::dec;
      }
      ss << " in position " << pos_curr;
      if (pos_next > pos_curr + 1) {
        ss << "-" << pos_next - 1;
      }
      ss << ": ";
      ss << [&] {
        switch (it.success().error()) {
