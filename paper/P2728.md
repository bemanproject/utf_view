# High-Level Overview

This paper introduces views and ranges for transcoding between UTF formats:

`static_assert((u8"🙂" | views::to_utf32 | ranges::to<u32string>()) == U"🙂");`

It handles errors by replacing invalid subsequences with �:

`static_assert((u8"🙂" | views::take(3) | to_utf32 | ranges::to<std::u32string>()) == U"�");`

And by providing `or_error` views that provide `std::expected`:

```cpp
static_assert(
  *(u8"🙂" | views::take(3) | views::to_utf32_or_error).begin() ==
  unexpected{utf_transcoding_error::truncated_utf8_sequence});
```

# UTF Primer

If you're already familiar with Unicode, you can skip this section.

The Unicode standard maps _abstract characters_ to _code points_ in the
_Unicode codespace_ from `0` to `0x10FFFF`. Unicode text forms a _coded
character sequence_, "an ordered sequence of one or more code points."
[@Definitions]

The simplest way of encoding code points is UTF-32, which encodes code points
as a sequence of 32-bit unsigned integers. The building blocks of an encoding
are _code units_, and UTF-32 has the most direct mapping between code points
and code units.

![](../../paper/images/utf32.png){ width=400px }

Any values greater than `0x10FFFF` are rejected by validators for being
outside the range of valid Unicode.

Next is UTF-16, which exists for the historical reason that the Unicode
codespace used to top out at `0xFFFF`. Code points outside this range are
represented using _surrogates_, a reserved area in codespace which allows
combining the low 10 bits of two code units to form a single code point.

![](../../paper/images/utf16.png){ width=400px }

![](../../paper/images/utf16_2.png){ width=300px }

UTF-16 is rendered invalid by improper use of surrogates: a high surrogate not
followed by a low surrogate or a low surrogate not preceded by a high
surrogate. Note that the presence of any surrogate code points in UTF-32 is
also invalid.

Finally, UTF-8, the most ubiquitous and most complex encoding. This uses 8-bit
code units. If the high bit of the code unit is unset, the code unit
represents its ASCII equivalent for backwards compatibility. Otherwise the
code unit is either a start byte, which describes how long the subsequence is
(two to four bytes long), or a continuation byte, which fills out the
subsequence with the remaining data.

![](../../paper/images/utf8.png){ width=750px }

![](../../paper/images/utf8_2.png){ width=400px }

UTF-8 code unit sequences can be invalid for many reasons, such as a start
byte not followed by the correct number of continuation bytes, or a UTF-8
subsequence that encodes a surrogate.

_Transcoding_ in this context refers to the conversion of characters between
these three encodings.

# Existing Standard UTF Interfaces in C and C++

## C

C contains an alphabet soup of transcoding functions in `<stdlib.h>`,
`<wchar.h>`, and `<uchar.h>`. [@NTMBS]

This paper doesn't fully litigate these functions' flaws (see WG14
[@WG14N2902] for a more detailed explanation). Some of the issues users
encounter include reliance on an internal global conversion state, reliance on
the current setting of the global C locale, optimization barriers in
one-code-unit-at-a-time function calls, and inadequate error handling that
does not support replacement of invalid subsequences with � as specified by
Unicode.

[Example](https://godbolt.org/z/hrv78oKqo):

```c
setlocale(LC_ALL, "en_US.utf8");
char c[5] = {0};
const char16_t* w = u"\xd83d\xdd74";
mbstate_t state;
memset(&state, 0, sizeof(state));
c16rtomb(c, w[0], &state);
c16rtomb(c, w[1], &state);
const char* e = "\xf0\x9f\x95\xb4";
assert(strcmp(c, e) == 0);
```

## C++

C++'s existing transcoding functionality, other than the aforementioned
functions it inherits from C, consists of the set of `std::codecvt` facets
provided in `<locale>` and `<codecvt>`.

[Example](https://godbolt.org/z/Yncfqeesa):

```cpp
std::wstring_convert<std::codecvt_utf8<char32_t>, char32_t> conv;
std::string c = conv.to_bytes(U"🙂");
assert(c == "\xf0\x9f\x99\x82");
```

All of the Unicode-specific functionality in this header was deprecated in
C++17, and [@P2871R3] and [@P2873R2] finally remove most of it in C++26. There
are many concerns about these interfaces, particularly with respect to
safety.

These functions throw exceptions on encountering invalid UTF. Unicode
functions that use exceptions for error handling are a well-known footgun
because users consistently invoke them on untrusted user input without
handling the exceptions properly, leading to denial-of-service
vulnerabilities.

An example of this anti-pattern (although not involving these specific
functions) can be found in [@CVE-2007-3917], where a multiplayer RPG server
could be crashed by malicious users sending invalid UTF. Below is the patch:
[@wesnoth]

```cpp
@[`-`]{.rm}@ @[`msg = font::word_wrap_text(msg,font::SIZE_SMALL,map_outside_area().w*3/4);       `]{.rm}@
@[`+`]{.add}@ @[`try {                                                                            `]{.add}@
@[`+`]{.add}@     @[`// We've had a joker who send an invalid utf-8 message to crash clients      `]{.add}@
@[`+`]{.add}@     @[`// so now catch the exception and ignore the message.                        `]{.add}@
@[`+`]{.add}@     @[`msg = font::word_wrap_text(msg,font::SIZE_SMALL,map_outside_area().w*3/4);   `]{.add}@
@[`+`]{.add}@ @[`} catch (utils::invalid_utf8_exception&) {                                       `]{.add}@
@[`+`]{.add}@     @[`LOG_STREAM(err, engine) << "Invalid utf-8 found, chat message is ignored.\n";`]{.add}@
@[`+`]{.add}@     @[`return;                                                                      `]{.add}@
@[`+`]{.add}@ @[`}                                                                                `]{.add}@
```

Because it doesn't use exceptions, the functionality proposed by this paper
can serve as a safe, modern replacement for the deprecated and removed
`codecvt` facets.

# Replacing Ill-Formed Subsequences with "�"

When a transcoder encounters an invalid subsequence, the modern best practice
is to replace it in the output with one or more � characters (`U+FFFD`,
`REPLACEMENT CHARACTER`). The methodology for doing so is described in §3.9.6
of the Unicode Standard v17.0, Substitution of Maximal Subparts
[@Substitution].

For UTF-32 and UTF-16, each invalid code unit is replaced by an individual �
character.

For UTF-8, the same rule applies except if "a sequence of two or three bytes
is a truncated version of a sequence which is otherwise well-formed to that
point." In the latter case, the full two-to-three byte subsequence is replaced
by a single � character.

For example, UTF-8 encodes 🙂 as `0xF0` `0x9F` `0x99` `0x82`.

If that sequence of bytes is truncated to just `0xF0` `0x9F` `0x99`, it
becomes a single � replacement character.

On the other hand, if the first byte of the four-byte sequence is changed from
`0xF0` to `0xFF`, then it's replaced by four replacement characters, ����,
because no valid UTF-8 subsequence begins with `0xFF`.

More subtly, the subsequence `0xED` `0xA0` must be replaced with two
replacement characters, ��, because any continuation of that subsequence can
only result in a surrogate code point, so it can't prefix any valid
subsequence.

Each of the proposed `to_utfN_view` views adheres to this specification. The
`to_utfN_as_error` views also use this scheme but produce
`unexpected<utf_transcoding_error>` values instead of replacement characters.

# Design Overview

## Transcoding Views

Invoking `begin()` or `end()` on a transcoding view constructs an instance of
an exposition-only `@*to-utf-view-impl*@::@*iterator*@` type.

The `@*to-utf-view-impl*@::@*iterator*@` stores an iterator pointing to the
start of the character it's transcoding, and a back-pointer to the underlying
range in order to bounds check its beginning and end (which is required for
correctness, not just safety).

The `@*to-utf-view-impl*@::@*iterator*@` maintains a small buffer (`buf_`)
containing between one and four code units, which comprise the current
character in the target encoding.

It also maintains an index (`buf_index_`) into this buffer, which it increments
or decrements when `operator++` or `operator--` is invoked, respectively. If
it runs out of code units in the buffer, it reads more elements from the
underlying view. `operator*` provides the current element of the buffer.

Below is an approximate block diagram of the iterator. Bold lines denote
actual data members of the iterator; dashed lines are just function calls.

![](../../paper/images/iterator.png){ width=500px }

The `@*to-utf-view-impl*@::@*iterator*@` is converting the string `Qϕ学𡪇`
from UTF-8 to UTF-16. The user has iterated the view to the first UTF-16 code
unit of the fourth character. `base_` points to the start of the fourth
character in the input. `buf_` contains both UTF-16 code units of the fourth
character; `buf_index_` keeps track of the fact that we're currently pointing
to the first one. If we invoke `operator++` on the
`@*to-utf-view-impl*@::@*iterator*@`, it will increment `buf_index_` to point
to the second code unit. On the other hand, if we invoke `operator--`, it will
notice that `buf_index_` is already at the beginning and move backward from
the fourth character to the third character by invoking
`@*read-reverse*@()`. The `@*read*@()` and `@*read-reverse*@()` functions
contain most of the actual transcoding logic, updating `base_` and filling
`buf_` up with the transcoded characters.

Iterating a bidirectional transcoding view backwards produces, in reverse
order, the exact same sequence of characters or `expected` values as are
produced by iterating the view forwards.

### `utf_transcoding_error`

Each transcoding view, like `to_utf8_view`, which produces a range of
`char8_t` and handles errors by substituting � replacement characters, has a
corresponding `_or_error` equivalent, like `to_utf8_view_or_error`, which
produces a range of `expected<char8_t, utf_transcoding_error>` and handles
errors by substituting `unexpected<utf_transcoding_error>`s.

`utf_transcoding_error` is an enumeration whose enumerators are:

- `truncated_utf8_sequence`
    - An ill-formed subsequence that matches the beginning of some well-formed
      sequence.
    - Example invalid code unit sequence: UTF-8 `0xE1 0x80`.
- `unpaired_high_surrogate`
    - Example invalid code unit sequence: UTF-16 `0xD800`.
- `unpaired_low_surrogate`
    - Example invalid code unit sequence: UTF-16 `0xDC00`.
- `unexpected_utf8_continuation_byte`
    - Example invalid code unit sequence: UTF-8 `0x80`.
- `overlong`
    - An overlong UTF-8 encoding.
    - Example invalid code unit sequence: UTF-8 `0xE0 0x80`.
- `encoded_surrogate`
    - Applies to both UTF-8 and UTF-32.
    - Example invalid code unit sequence: UTF-8 `0xED 0xA0`, UTF-32
      `0x0000D800`.
- `out_of_range`
    - Applies to both UTF-8 and UTF-32
    - In UTF-8, this applies to `0xF4` if it is followed by a continuation
      byte greater than `0x8F`
    - In UTF-32, this is any code unit greater than `0x10FFFF`
    - Example invalid code unit sequence: UTF-8 `0xF4 0x90`, UTF-32
      `0x110000`.
- `invalid_utf8_leading_byte`
    - In UTF-8, this applies to `0xC0`-`0xC1` and `0xF5`-`0xFF`.
    - Example invalid code unit sequence: UTF-8 `0xC0`.

An alternative approach to minimize the number of enumerators could merge
`truncated_utf8_sequence` with `unpaired_high_surrogate` and merge
`unexpected_utf8_continuation_byte` with `unpaired_low_surrogate`, but based
on feedback, splitting these up seems to be preferred.

The table below compares the error handling behavior of the `to_utf16` and
`to_utf16_or_error` views on various sample UTF-8 inputs from the
"Substitution of Maximal Subparts" section of the Unicode standard:
[@SubstitutionExamples]

![](../../paper/images/error_handling.png){ width=750px }

## Code Unit Views

SG16 has a goal to ensure that C++ standard library functions that expect
UTF-encoded input do not accept parameters of type `char` or `wchar_t`, whose
encodings are implementation-defined, and instead use `char8_t`, `char16_t`,
and `char32_t`. These views follow that pattern.

Because virtually all UTF-8 text processed by C++ is stored in `char` (and
similarly for UTF-16 and `wchar_t`), this means that we need a terse way to
smooth over the transition for users. To do so, this paper introduces views
for casting to the `charN_t` types: `as_char8_t`, `as_char16_t`, and
`as_char32_t`.

These are syntactic sugar for producing a `std::ranges::transform_view` with
an exposition-only transformation functor that performs the needed cast.

# Additional Examples

## Transcoding a UTF-8 String Literal to a `std::u32string`

```cpp
std::u32string hello_world =
  u8"こんにちは世界" | std::views::to_utf32 | std::ranges::to<std::u32string>();
```

## Sanitizing Potentially Invalid Unicode

Note that transcoding to and from the same encoding is not a no-op; it must
maintain the invariant that the output of a transcoding view is always valid
UTF.

```cpp
template <typename CharT>
std::basic_string<CharT> sanitize(CharT const* str) {
  return std::null_term(str) | std::views::to_utf<CharT> | std::ranges::to<std::basic_string<CharT>>();
}
```

## Returning the Final Non-ASCII Code Point in a String, Transcoding Backwards Lazily

```cpp
std::optional<char32_t> last_nonascii(std::ranges::view auto str) {
  for (auto c : str | std::views::to_utf32 | std::views::reverse
                    | std::views::filter([](char32_t c) { return c > 0x7f; })) {
    return c;
  }
  return std::nullopt;
}
```

## Transcoding Strings and Throwing a Descriptive Exception on Invalid UTF

(This assumes a reflection-based `enum_to_string` function.)

```cpp
template <typename FromChar, typename ToChar>
std::basic_string<ToChar> transcode_or_throw(std::basic_string_view<FromChar> input) {
  std::basic_string<ToChar> result;
  auto view = input | std::views::to_utf_or_error<ToChar>;
  for (auto it = view.begin(), end = view.end(); it != end; ++it) {
    if ((*it).has_value()) {
      result.push_back(**it);
    } else {
      throw std::runtime_error("error at position " +
                               std::to_string(it.base() - input.begin()) + ": " +
                               enum_to_string((*it).error()));
    }
  }
  return result;
}
```

```cpp
  // prints: "error at position 2: truncated_utf8_sequence"
  transcode_or_throw<char8_t, char16_t>(
    u8"hi🙂" | std::views::take(5) | std::ranges::to<std::u8string>());
```

## Changing the Suits of Unicode Playing Card Characters

```cpp
enum class suit : std::uint8_t {
  spades = 0xA,
  hearts = 0xB,
  diamonds = 0xC,
  clubs = 0xD
};

// Unicode playing card characters are laid out such that changing the second least
// significant nibble changes the suit, e.g.
// U+1F0A1 PLAYING CARD ACE OF SPADES
// U+1F0B1 PLAYING CARD ACE OF HEARTS
constexpr char32_t change_playing_card_suit(char32_t card, suit s) {
  if (U'\N{PLAYING CARD ACE OF SPADES}' <= card && card <= U'\N{PLAYING CARD KING OF CLUBS}') {
    return (card & ~(0xF << 4)) | (static_cast<std::uint8_t>(s) << 4);
  }
  return card;
}

void change_playing_card_suits() {
  std::u8string_view const spades = u8"🂡🂢🂣🂤🂥🂦🂧🂨🂩🂪🂫🂭🂮";
  std::u8string const hearts =
    spades |
    to_utf32 |
    std::views::transform(std::bind_back(change_playing_card_suit, suit::hearts)) |
    to_utf8 |
    std::ranges::to<std::u8string>();
  assert(hearts == u8"🂱🂲🂳🂴🂵🂶🂷🂸🂹🂺🂻🂽🂾");
}
```

# Dependencies

The code unit views depend on [@P3117R1] "Extending Conditionally Borrowed".

# Implementation Experience

The most recent revision of this paper has a reference implementation called
[beman.utf_view](https://github.com/bemanproject/utf_view) available on
GitHub, which is a fork of Jonathan Wakely's implementation of P2728R6 as an
implementation detail for libstdc++. It is part of the Beman project.

Versions of the interfaces provided by previous revisions of this paper have
also been implemented, and re-implemented, several times over the last 5 years
or so, as part of a proposed (but not yet accepted!) Boost library,
[Boost.Text](https://github.com/tzlaine/text). Boost.Text has hundreds of
stars on GitHub.

Both libraries have comprehensive tests.

# Wording

## Additional Helper Concepts

Add the following to [range.utility.helpers]{.sref}:

```c++
  template<class T>
    concept @*code-unit*@ = 
      same_as<remove_cv_t<T>, char8_t> || same_as<remove_cv_t<T>, char16_t> || same_as<remove_cv_t<T>, char32_t>;
```

## Transcoding views

Add the following subclause to [range.adaptors]{.sref}:

### 24.7.? Transcoding views [range.transcoding] {-}

#### 24.7.?.1 Overview [range.transcoding.overview] {-}

`to_utf8_view` produces a view of the UTF-8 code units transcoded from the
elements of a `@*utf-range*@`. `to_utf16_view` produces a view of the UTF-16
code units transcoded from the elements of a `@*utf-range*@`. `to_utf32_view`
produces a view of the UTF-32 code units transcoded from the elements of a
`@*utf-range*@`. Their `or_error` equivalents produce a view of
`expected<charN_t, utf_transcoding_error>` where invalid input subsequences
result in errors.

`@*to-utf-view-impl*@` is an exposition-only class that provides
implementation details common to the six aforementioned transcoding views. It
transcodes from UTF-N to UTF-M, where N and M are each one of 8, 16, or 32. N
may equal M. `@*to-utf-view-impl*@`'s `ToType` template parameter is based on
a mapping between character types and UTF encodings, which is that that
`char8_t` corresponds to UTF-8, `char16_t` corresponds to UTF-16, and
`char32_t` corresponds to UTF-32.

The names `views::to_utf8`, `views::to_utf8_or_error`, `views::to_utf16`,
`views::to_utf16_or_error`, `views::to_utf32`, and `views::to_utf32_or_error`
denote range adaptor objects ([range.adaptor.object]). `views::to_utf` and
`views::to_utf_or_error` denote range adaptor object
templates. `views::to_utfN` produces `to_utfN_view`s, and
`views::to_utfN_or_error` produces `views::to_utfN_or_error_view`s.

`views::to_utf<ToType>` is equivalent to `views::to_utf8` if `ToType` is
`char8_t`, `to_utf16` if `ToType` is `char16_t`, and `views::to_utf32` if
`ToType` is `char32_t`, and similarly for `views::to_utf_or_error`.

Let `views::to_utfN` denote any of the aforementioned range adaptor objects,
let `Char` be its corresponding character type, and let `V` denote the
`to_utfN_view` or `to_utfN_or_error_view` associated with that object. Let
`E` be an expression and let `T` be `remove_cvref_t<decltype((E))>`. If
`decltype((E))` does not model `@*utf-range*@`, `to_utfN(E)` is
ill-formed. The expression `to_utfN(E)` is expression-equivalent to:

- If `E` is a specialization of `empty_view` ([range.empty.view]), then
  `empty_view<Char>{}`.

- Otherwise, if `T` is an array type of known bound, then:

  - If the array extent is nonzero and the last element of the array is zero,
    then
    `V(std::ranges::subrange(std::ranges::begin(E), --std::ranges::end(E)))`
  - Otherwise,
    `V(std::ranges::subrange(std::ranges::begin(E), std::ranges::end(E)))`

- Otherwise, `V(std::views::all(E))`

#### 24.7.?.2 Enumeration `utf_transcoding_error` [range.transcoding.error] {-}

```c++

  encoded_surrogate,
  out_of_range,
  invalid_utf8_leading_byte
};
```

  constexpr auto reserve_hint() const requires approximately_sized_range<const V>;
};
```

```cpp
constexpr explicit @*to-utf-view-impl*@(V base);
```

_Effects_: Initializes `@*base_*@` with `std::move(base)`.

```cpp
constexpr @*iterator*@ begin();
```

_Returns:_ `{*this, std::ranges::begin(base_)}`

_Remarks:_ In order to provide the amortized constant time complexity required by the `range` concept when `@*to-utf-view-impl*@` transcodes from UTF-8 or UTF-16, this function caches the result within the `@*to-utf-view-impl*@` for use on subsequent calls.

```cpp
constexpr auto reserve_hint() requires approximately_sized_range<V>;
```

_Returns:_ The result is implementation-defined.

```cpp
constexpr auto reserve_hint() const requires approximately_sized_range<const V>;
```

_Returns:_ The result is implementation-defined.

::: note

The implementation of the `empty()` member function provided by the
transcoding views is more efficient than the one provided by `view_interface`,
since `view_interface`'s implementation will construct
`@*to-utf-view-impl*@::begin()` and `@*to-utf-view-impl*@::end()` and compare
them, whereas we can simply use the underlying range's `empty()`, since a
transcoding view is empty if and only if its underlying range is empty.

::: note

`@*to-utf-view-impl*@::@*iterator*@` does its work by adapting an underlying
range of code units. We use the term "input subsequence" to refer to a
potentially ill-formed code unit subsequence which is to be transcoded into a
code point `c`. Each input subsequence is decoded from the UTF encoding
corresponding to `@*from-type*@`. If the underlying range contains ill-formed
UTF, the code units are divided into input subsequences according to
Substitution of Maximal Subparts, and each ill-formed input subsequence is
transcoded into a `U+FFFD`. `c` is then encoded to `ToType`'s corresponding
encoding, into an internal code unit buffer `buf_`.

:::

::: note

`@*to-utf-view-impl*@::@*iterator*@` maintains invariants on `base()` which
differ depending on whether it's an input iterator. In both cases, if `*this`
is at the end of the range being adapted, then `base()` == `@*end*@()`. But if
it's not at the end of the adapted range, and it's an input iterator, then the
position of `base()` is always at the end of the input subsequence
corresponding to the current code point. On the other hand, for forward and
bidirectional iterators, the position of `base()` is always at the beginning
of the input subsequence corresponding to the current code point.

:::

`@*to-utf-view-impl*@::@*iterator*@::iterator_concept` is defined as follows:

- If `V` models `bidirectional_range`, then `iterator_concept` is `bidirectional_iterator_tag`.
- Otherwise, if `V` models `forward_range`, then `iterator_concept` is `forward_iterator_tag`.
- Otherwise, `iterator_concept` is `input_iterator_tag`.

The member *typedef-name* `iterator_category` is defined if and only if `V` models `forward_range`.

In that case, `@*to-utf-view-impl*@::@*iterator*@::iterator_category` is defined as follows:

- Let `C` denote the type `iterator_traits<iterator_t<V>>::iterator_category`.
- If `C` models `derived_from<bidirectional_iterator_tag>`, then `iterator_category` denotes `bidirectional_iterator_tag`.
- Otherwise, if `C` models `derived_from<forward_iterator_tag>`, then `iterator_category` denotes `forward_iterator_tag`.
- Otherwise, `iterator_category` denotes `C`.

```cpp
constexpr value_type operator*() const;
```

_Returns_: Either `buf_[buf_index_]`, or, if `OrError` is `true` and `!@*success*@()`, then `unexpected{@*success*@().error()}`

```cpp
constexpr expected<void, utf_transcoding_error> @*success*@() const noexcept requires(OrError); // @*exposition only*@
```

_Returns_:

- If `@*from-type*@` is `char8_t`:

  - If the current input subsequence is a code unit between 0x80 and 0xBF,
    returns `unexpected_utf8_continuation_byte`.
  - If the current input subsequence is a code unit between 0xC0 and 0xC2, or
    between 0xF5 and 0xFF, returns `invalid_utf8_leading_byte`.
  - If the current input subsequence is the code unit 0xE0, and the subsequent
    input subsequence is a code unit between 0x80 and 0x9F; or if the current
    input subsequence is the code unit 0xF0, and the subsequent input
    subsequence is a code unit between 0x80 and 0x8F; then returns `overlong`.
  - If the current input subsequence is the code unit 0xED, and the subsequent
    input subsequence is a code unit between 0xA0 and 0xBF, then returns
    `encoded_surrogate`.
  - If the the current input subsequence is the code unit 0xF4, and the
    subsequent input subsequence is a code unit between 0x90 and 0xBF, then
    returns `out_of_range`.
  - Otherwise, if the current input subsequence is invalid UTF-8, begins with
    a code unit between 0xC2 and 0xF4, and there exists some hypothetical
    sequence of code units which would make the current input subsequence
    well-formed if concatenated to the end of it, then returns
    `truncated_utf8_sequence`.

- If `@*from-type*@` is `char16_t`:

  - If the current input subsequence is a code unit between 0xD800 and 0xDBFF,
    returns `unpaired_high_surrogate`.
  - If the current input subsequence is a code unit between 0xDC00 and 0xDFFF,
    returns `unpaired_low_surrogate`.

- If `@*from-type*@` is `char32_t`:

  - If the current input subsequence is between 0xD800 and 0xDFFF, returns
    `encoded_surrogate`.
  - If the current input subsequence is between 0x110000 and 0xFFFFFFFF,
    returns `out_of_range`.

Otherwise, returns `expected<void, utf_transcoding_error>()`.

```cpp
constexpr void @*read*@(); // @*exposition only*@
```

_Effects_:

Decodes the input subsequence starting at position `base()` into a code point
`c`, using the UTF encoding corresponding to `@*from-type*@`, and setting `c`
to U+FFFD if the input subsequence is ill-formed. It sets `to_increment_` to
the number of code units read while decoding `c`. encodes `c` into `buf_` in
the UTF encoding corresponding to `ToType`, and sets `buf_index_` to `0`. If
`forward_iterator<I>` is `true`, `base()` is set to the position it had before
`read` was called.

```cpp
constexpr void @*read-reverse*@(); // @*exposition only*@
```

_Effects_:

Decodes the input subsequence ending at position `base()` into a code point
`c`, using the UTF encoding corresponding to `@*from-type*@`, and setting `c`
to U+FFFD if the input subsequence is ill-formed. It sets `to_increment_` to
the number of code units read while decoding `c`; encodes `c` into `buf_` in
the UTF encoding corresponding to `ToType`; and sets `buf_index_` to
`buf_.size() - 1`, or to `0` if this is an `or_error` view and we read an
invalid subsequence.

## Code unit adaptors

Add the following subclause to [range.adaptors]{.sref}:

### 24.7.? Code unit adaptors [range.codeunitadaptor] {-}

```cpp
template<class T>
struct @*implicit-cast-to*@ { // @*exposition only*@/
  constexpr T operator()(auto x) const noexcept { return x; }
};
```

The names `as_char8_t`, `as_char16_t`, and `as_char32_t` denote range adaptor
objects ([range.adaptor.object]). Let `as_charN_t` denote any one of
`as_char8_t`, `as_char16_t`, and `as_char32_t`. Let `Char` be the
corresponding character type for `as_charN_t`, let `E` be an expression and
let `T` be `remove_cvref_t<decltype((E))>`. If `ranges::range_reference_t<T>`
does not model `convertible_to<Char>`, `as_charN_t(E)` is ill-formed. The
expression `as_charN_t(E)` is expression-equivalent to:

- If `T` is a specialization of `empty_view` ([range.empty.view]), then
  `empty_view<Char>{}`.

- Otherwise, if `T` is an array type of known bound, then:

  - If the array extent is nonzero and the last element of the array is zero,
    then
    `ranges::transform_view(std::ranges::subrange(std::ranges::begin(E), --std::ranges::end(E)), @*implicit-cast-to*@<Char>{})`
  - Otherwise,
    `ranges::transform_view(std::ranges::subrange(std::ranges::begin(E), std::ranges::end(E)), @*implicit-cast-to*@<Char>{})`

- Otherwise, `ranges::transform_view(std::views::all(E), @*implicit-cast-to*@<Char>{})`

\[Example 1:
```c++
std::vector<int> path_as_ints = {U'C', U':', U'\x00010000'};
std::filesystem::path path = path_as_ints | as_char32_t | std::ranges::to<std::u32string>();
const auto& native_path = path.native();
if (native_path != std::wstring{L'C', L':', L'\xD800', L'\xDC00'}) {
  return false;
}
```

## Feature test macro

Add the following macro definition to [version.syn]{.sref}, header `<version>`

```

# Design Discussion and Alternatives

## Special CPO Logic for String Literals

The `to_utfN` CPOs use a heuristic to detect null-terminated ranges and omit
the null terminator so that it doesn't appear in the output. If the input
range satisfies `is_bounded_array_v`, is nonempty, and its last element is 0,
then the last element is omitted.

Without this logic, you'd have:

```c++
static_assert(
  std::ranges::equal(u8"foo" | to_utf32, std::array{U'f', U'o', U'o', U'\0'}));
```

Instead, with the heuristic in place, the null terminator is eliminated:

```c++
static_assert(
  std::ranges::equal(u8"foo" | to_utf32, std::array{U'f', U'o', U'o'}));
```

## The `_or_error` Views Are Basis Operations for Other Error Handling Behaviors

You can use the `_or_error` view to implement the same behavior that the
non-`std::expected`-based views have.

For example, `foo | std::views::to_utf8` has the same output as:

```c++
foo
  | std::views::to_utf8_or_error
  | std::views::transform(
      [](std::expected<char8_t, std::utf_transcoding_error> c)
        -> std::inplace_vector<char8_t, 3>
      {
        if (c.has_value()) {
          return {c.value()};
        } else {
          // U+FFFD
          return {u8'\xEF', u8'\xBF', u8'\xBD'};
        }
      })
  | std::views::join
```

You can also substitute a different replacement character by changing the
result of the `else` clause, or add exception-based error handling by throwing
at that point.

## Caching `begin()`

When we transcode from UTF-8, invoking `begin()` on the transcoding view may read up to
four elements from the underlying view. Similarly, when transcoding from UTF-16, it may
read up to two underlying elements. As a result, in order to preserve "amortized O(1)
complexity," we need to cache `begin()` in these situations.

On the other hand, when transcoding from UTF-32, `begin()` reads at most one element from
the underlying view, so `begin()` is not cached when doing so.

We also incorporate [@P3725R1]'s approach, in that when a transcoding view wraps a
const-iterable `input_range` that is not a `forward_range`, the transcoding view provides
a `const` overload of `begin()` that is non-caching.

However, we do not provide [@P3725R1]-style `views::input_to_utf8` CPOs; for that use
case, we expect users to simply spell `views::to_input | views::to_utf8`.

## Why There Are Three `to_utfN_view`s and No `to_utf_view`

This section starts with an simplified, idealized, but unimplementable design, and works
backwards from there to various hypothetical alternatives, including the design that's
proposed in the current revision.

### `to_utf_view` with Unary Constructor

Imagine we had a single `to_utf_view`, and users specified which encoding to transcode
to via template parameter:

```c++
std::u32string transcode_to_utf8(const std::u8string& str) {
  return std::ranges::to_utf_view<char32_t>(str) | std::ranges::to<std::u32string>();
}
```

Why doesn't this work?

Well, in this scenario, `to_utf_view` would have two template parameters, one for the
`ToType` and one for the underlying view:

```c++
template<@*code-unit*@ ToType, input_range V>
  requires view<V> && @*code-unit*@<range_value_t<V>>
class to_utf_view {
// ...
```

Spelling the constructor invocation as `std::ranges::to_utf_view<char32_t>(str)` doesn't
work, because CTAD is all-or-nothing; you can't specify the `ToType` explicitly and still
deduce the `input_range V`.

### `to_utf_view` with Tag Type Constructor

One alternative would be to have CTAD deduce the `charN_t` template parameter from the
parameters of the constructor using some kind of tag:

```c++
std::u32string transcode_to_utf8(const std::u8string& str) {
  return std::ranges::to_utf_view(str, std::ranges::utf_tag<char32_t>{}) 
         | std::ranges::to<std::u32string>();
}
```

This is a viable alternative to the status quo.

But let's revisit the unary constructor approach.

### `to_utf_view` with Unary Constructor and `to_utfN_view` Views as Type Aliases

Let's try keeping `std::ranges::to_utf_view`'s unary constructor from before, and then
we'll add `to_utf8_view`, `to_utf16_view`, and `to_utf32_view` as type aliases of
`to_utf_view`:

```c++
template <class V>
using to_utf8_view = to_utf_view<char8_t, V>;

template <class V>
using to_utf16_view = to_utf_view<char16_t, V>;

template <class V>
using to_utf32_view = to_utf_view<char32_t, V>;
```

Now let me fill in some additional background on how CTAD works for views. All views in
the standard have a user-defined deduction guide that ensures that when a range is passed
to the contructor of a view, it gets wrapped in `views::all_t`, e.g.:

```c++
template<class R>
  explicit join_view(R&&) -> join_view<views::all_t<R>>;
```

Miraculously, thanks to [@P1814R0], we could write a deduction guide like the following,
and all of the `to_utfN_view` aliases specified above would just work:

```c++
template<@*code-unit*@ ToType, class R>
to_utf_view(R&&) -> to_utf_view<ToType, views::all_t<R>>;
```

But the problem is that, without going through an alias, it's still not possible to invoke
the constructor of `to_utf_view` in a way that activates that deduction guide. Users would
need to explicitly write down the type of the underlying view and the destination
encoding:

```c++
std::u32string transcode_to_utf8(const std::u8string& str) {
  return std::ranges::to_utf_view<char32_t, std::ranges::ref_view<const std::u8string>>(str)
         | std::ranges::to<std::u32string>();
}
```

Which isn't really viable.

### `to_utfN_view` Views As Thin Wrappers Around an Implementation-Defined `@*to-utf-view-impl*@`

This is the status quo in the current revision: rename `to_utf_view` to
`@*to-utf-view-impl*@` and add separate `to_utf8_view`, `to_utf16_view`, and
`to_utf32_view` classes that each contain a `@*to-utf-view-impl*@` data member.

Although this wording strategy is somewhat novel, it allows us to write down conventional
user-defined deduction guides for each of these views:

```c++
template<class R>
  to_utf8_view(R&&) -> to_utf8_view<views::all_t<R>>;
```

## CPO Template

The section above describes limitations imposed on us by the requirements of the deduction
guides of the view constructors. On the other hand, the CPOs have no such limitations.

This paper introduces a novelty: a CPO template. This is the mechanism by which users can
decide the encoding that they're converting to via template parameter:

```
template <typename FromCharT, typename ToCharT>
std::basic_string<ToCharT> transcode_to(std::basic_string<FromCharT> const& input) {
  return input | to_utf<ToCharT> | std::ranges::to<std::basic_string<ToCharT>>();
}
```

## Optimizing for Double-Transcoding

In generic code, it's possible to introduce transcoding views that wrap other transcoding
views:

```c++
void foo(std::ranges::view auto v) {
#ifdef _MSC_VER
  windows_function(v | std::views::to_utf16);
#endif
  // ...
}

int main(int, char const* argv[]) {
  foo(std::null_term(argv[1]) | std::views::as_char8_t | std::views::to_utf32);
}
```

In the above example, if the user is building on Windows, `foo` will create a
`to_utf16_view` wrapping a `to_utf32_view`.

### Eliding the Inner Transcoding View in the CPO

You might want to add logic in the CPO such that it notices that `foo` is creating a
`to_utf16_view` wrapping a `to_utf32_view`, elides the `to_utf16_view`, and creates the
`to_utf32_view` directly wrapping the view produced by `as_char8_t`.

However, this runs into issues where the result of `base()` isn't what the user
expects. Consider this transcode function that works similarly to `std::ranges::copy`, in
that it returns both the output iterator and the final position of the input iterator:

```c++
template <typename I, typename O>
using transcode_result = std::ranges::in_out_result<I, O>;

template <std::input_iterator I, std::sentinel_for<I> S, std::output_iterator<char8_t> O>
transcode_result<I, O> transcode_to_utf32(I first, S last, O out) {
  auto r = std::ranges::subrange(first, last) | to_utf32;

  auto copy_result = std::ranges::copy(r, out);

  return transcode_result<I, O>{copy_result.in.base(), copy_result.out};
}
```

if `copy_result.in.base()` is a different type than `first`, this will break.

### "Innermost" Optimization

Instead, the iterator of the transcoding view can "look through" the iterator of the inner
transcoding view that it's wrapping. Since the iterator is just a backpointer to the
parent and an iterator to the current position, optimizing like this instead points the
backpointer to its parent's parent, and uses the inner iterator of the iterator it's
wrapping for the current position. We use exposition-only concepts named
`@*innermost-parent*@` and `@*innermost-base*@` to explicate how this works in the
wording.

The wording change that would enable this optimization is as follows:

#### Additional helper templates

```diff
+  template<class T>
+  concept @*to-utf-view-iterator-optimizable*@ = @*unspecified*@ // @*exposition only*@
+  template<class T>
+  concept @*to-utf-view-sentinel-optimizable*@ = @*unspecified*@ // @*exposition only*@
```

These concepts are true when the type in question is the iterator/sentinel of a transcoding view.

```diff

## Changes since R7

- Add playing card example.
- Remove `iterator_interface` from `@*utf-iterator*@`.
- Replace code unit views with range adaptor closure objects that are
  expression-equivalent to P3117 `transform_view`.
- Move `null_sentinel` and `null_term` into P3705.
- Remove `std::uc` namespace and replace it with `std::ranges` and `std::ranges::views`.
- Remove library EB.
- Change iterator to use a back-pointer to its parent view, removing
  borrowedness and quadratic stack size growth.
- Remove support for `char` and `wchar_t`.
- Rewrite most of the verbiage and add new diagrams.

## Changes since R6

- Fix a bug in `null_sentinel_t` causing it not to satisfy `sentinel_for` by
  changing its `operator==` to return `bool`.
- Fix a bug in `null_sentinel_t` where it did not support non-copyable input
  iterators by having operator== take input iterators by reference.
- Rename `as_utfN` to `to_utfN` to emphasize that a conversion is taking place
  and to contrast with the code unit views, which remain named `as_charN_t`.
- Refactor `utf_view` into an exposition-only `@*utf-view-impl*@` class used
  as an implementation detail of separate `to_utf8_view`, `to_utf16_view`, and
  `to_utf32_view` classes, addressing broken deduction guides in the previous
  revision.
- Remove `project_view` and copy most of its implementation into separate
  `char8_view`, `char16_view`, and `char32_view` classes, addressing broken
  deduction guides in the previous revision.
- Change `utf_iterator` to an exposition-only member class of
  `@*utf-view-impl*@`.
- Eliminate iterator unpacking mechanism and replace it with an alternative
  solution to the problem of transcoding ranges wrapping other transcoding
  ranges. This simplifies the API at the expense of removing the transcoding
  iterator's `begin()` and `end()` member functions and losing the ability to
  implement unpacking for user-defined UTF iterators.
- Remove `std::uc::format`.
- Make all concepts exposition-only.
- Remove `utf_transcoding_error_handler` mechanism.
- Introduce new error handling mechanism based on a new `utf_transcoding_error`

  transcoding view's iterator.
- Remove ability to pass pointers to range adaptor closure objects, which
  violated the restriction that only ranges may be passed to range adaptor
  closure objects.
- Remove `std::format` and `std::ostream` functionality. It doesn't make sense
  for this mechanism to be the only way we have to format/output `char8_t`; we
  can revisit this functionality when we have already figured out how to
  support e.g. `std::u8string`.
- Replace code examples with new ones reflecting API changes.
- Provide a reference implementation.

## Changes since R5

- Simplify the complicated constraint on the comparison operator for
  `null_sentinel_t`.
- Introduce `ranges::project_view`, and implement `charN_view`s in terms of
  that.
- Convert the `utfN_view`s to aliases, rather than individual classes.

## Changes since R4

- Replace `unpacking_owning_view` with `unpacking_view`, and use it to do
  unpacking, rather than sometimes doing the unpacking in the adaptor.
- Ensure `const` and non-`const` overloads for `begin` and `end` in all views.
- Move `null_sentinel_t` to `std`, remove its `base` member function, and make
  it useful for more than just pointers, based on SG-9 guidance.

## Changes since R3

- Changed the definition of the `code_unit` concept, and added `as_charN_t`
  adaptors.
- Removed the utility functions and Unicode-related constants, except
  `replacement_character`.
- Changed the constraint on `utf_iterator` slightly.
- Change `null_sentinel_t` back to being Unicode-specific.

## Changes since R2

- Add `noexcept` where appropriate.
- Remove non-essential constants and utility functions, and elaborate on the
  usage of the ones that remain.
- Note differences from similar elements proposed in [@P1629R1].
- Extend the examples slightly.
- Correct an error in the description of the view adaptors' semantics, and
  provide several examples of their use.

## Changes since R1

- Reintroduce the transcoding-from-a-buffer example.
- Generalize `null_sentinel_t` to a non-Unicode-specific facility.
- In utility functions that search for ill-formed encoding, take a range
  argument instead of a pair of iterator arguments.
- Replace `utf{8,16,32}_view` with a single `utf_view`.

## Changes since R0

- When naming code points in interfaces, use `char32_t`.
- When naming code units in interfaces, use `charN_t`.
- Remove each eager algorithm, leaving in its corresponding view.
- Remove all the output iterators.
- Change template parameters to `utfN_view` to the types of the from-range,
  instead of the types of the transcoding iterators used to implement the view.
- Remove all make-functions.
- Replace the misbegotten `as_utfN()` functions with the `as_utfN` view
  adaptors that should have been there all along.
- Add missing `utf_transcoding_error_handler` concept.
- Turn `unpack_iterator_and_sentinel` into a CPO.
- Lower the UTF iterator concepts from bidirectional to input.

note here that the authors doubt the viability of "a special case for char and

evaluation of a concept change based on the literal encoding seems like a
flaky move; the literal encoding can change TU to TU.
